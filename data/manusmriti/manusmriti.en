When about to study, he shall be taught with his face to the north, when he has sipped water according to law, has formed the Brahmāñjali (with his hands), wears light clothing and has the organs under full control.
At the beginning and at the end op the (study of) the Veda, the feet of the Teacher should always be clasped; and the veda should me studied with joined palms; this is what has been called the ‘Brahmāñjali.’
The clasping op the teacher’s feet should be done with crossed hands: the left should be touched with the left and the right with the right.
When the pupil is going to study, the Teacher, ever free from indolence, should say—‘ho, read!’ and he should cease when he says ‘let there be a stop!’
One should always pronounce the Praṇava in the beginning and at the end of the Veda. if it is not accompanied by the syllable ‘oṃ’ in the beginning, it trickles away; and (if it is not accompanied by it) at the end, it becomes shattered.
Seated upon Kuśa-blades pointing eastwards and sanctified by Kuśa-blades, when one has purified himself by means of three ‘breath-suspensions,’—then alone he becomes entitled to the syllable ‘oṃ.’
Out of the three Vedas, Prajāpati milked the letter ‘ a ,’ the letter ‘ u ’ and the letter ‘ m ’; as also the syllables ‘bhūḥ-bhuvaḥ-svaḥ.’
Out of the three Vedas again, the Supreme Prajāpati milked each foot of the Sāvitrī verse beginning with ‘tat.’
Reciting, at the two twilights, this syllable and this verse, preceded by the Vyāhṛtis, the Brāhmaṇa, learned in the Veda, becomes endowed with Vedic merit.
Repeating this Triad a thousand times in open air, the twice-born person becomes freed, in a month, from even great sin, as the snake from its slough.
Bereft of this verse, and of the timely performance of his own duty, a person of Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya or Vaiśya birth incurs the odium of good men.
The three imperishable Mahāvyāhṛtis preceded by the syllable ‘oṃ,’ and the three-footed Sāvitrī,—these should be regarded as the ‘Mouth of Brahman.’
He who, untired, recites this, day after day, for three years, turns into air, and becoming transfigured into Ākāśa, reaches the supreme brahman.
The mono-syllable is the highest Brahman; Breath-suspensions are the highest austerity; nothing is higher than the Sāvitrī verse; truth is better than Silence.
All vedic acts of oblation and sacrifice pass away; while this syllable (om) is to be regarded as imperishable; and it is Brahman, and also Prajāpati
The offering that consists in the repeating of mantras excels the enjoined (ritualistic) offering ten times; the inaudible (repeating) excels this latter a hundred times; and the Mental (repeating) excels it a thousandfold.
The four cooked offerings, along with the enjoined sacrifices,—all these are not worth the sixteenth part of the offering that consists in the repeating of mantras.
It is by means of repeating mantras that the Brāhmaṇa succeeds;—there is no doubt in this. he may, or may not, do anything else, one comes to be called a Brāhmaṇa if he is of a friendly disposition.
The wise man should put forth an effort to restrain his organs roaming among alluring objects; just as the driver restrains the horses.
Those eleven organs which the ancient sages have named I shall now fully describe in due order.
(They are) the Ear, the Skin, the Eyes, the Tongue and the Nose as the fifth; the Anus, the Generative Organ, the Hands and Feet, and Speech described as the tenth.
Of these the five beginning with the Ear in due order they call “Organs of Sensation’; and five of these, beginning with the Anus, “Organs of Action.”
The Mind is to be regarded as the eleventh, which, by its own quality, is of two-fold nature; and on this being subdued, both the aforesaid five-mentioned groups become subdued.
By attachment to the organs one incurs evil, without doubt; while by subjugating those same he attains success.
Never is desire appeased by the enjoyment of desires; it only waxes stronger, like fire by clarified butter.
As between one who would attain all these, and another who would renounce them all, the renunciation of desires surf asses the attainment of
These (organs), being contaminated with objects, are not capable of being subjugated by mere abstinence, as they are by ever present knowledge.
The Vedas, Renunciation, Sacrifices, Restraints and Austerities never attain fulfilment for one whose disposition is vitiated.
That man is to be known as having subjugated his sense-organs, who, on having heard, or touched, or seen, or tasted, or smelt, anything, neither rejoices nor grieves.
From among all the organs, if one happens to ooze out, then thereby his wisdom oozes out, just like water from one part of the leathern bag.
Having brought the host of organs under control, and having also subdued the mind, one should accomplish all his purposes, taking care not to injure his body.
Everyday during the earlier twilight one should stand repeating the Sāvitrī, till the sun becomes distinctly visible; and during the later twilight he should sit till the stars ark clearly seen.
One who, during the morning-twilight, repeats (the Sāvitrī) standing, removes the sin of the (preceding) night; while he who, during the evening-Twilight, repeats it seated, destroys the sin committed during the day.
But he who does not stand during the morning-twilight, and who does not sit through the evening-twilight, should be excluded, like the Sśūdra, from all that is due to twice-born persons.
Convinced of the necessary character of the injunction, and retiring to the forest on a spot near water, one may even recite the Sāvitrī only, with a clean body and a collected mind.
There is no regard for (observance of) days forbidden for study in connection with the appurtenances to the Veda, and with the mantras recited during oblations.
There is no “day forbidden for study” in regard to the daily recitation; since this has been called “Brahmasatra”; it is meritorious, being offered with the offering of study, and being maintained by the syllable “vaṣaṭ” in the shape of the recitation made on forbidden days.
He who, clean and self-controlled, recites the Veda, in due form, for one year,—for him this constantly fours out milk, curd, clarified butter and honey.
The twice-born person, whose Initiation has been performed, should continue to do, till the final Bath of “Return” (Samāvartana), tub kindling of fire, the begging of food, the sleeping on the ground and the acting for the teacher’s well- being.
The teacher’s son, one who is eager to do service, one who imparts knowledge, one who is righteous, one who is clean, a near relative, one who is competent, one who gives monet, one who is gentle, and one’s own (son)—these ten should be taught for the sake of merit.
One should not instruct any one unless he is asked; nor any one who asks in an improper manner. even though knowing (the truth), the wise man should behave, among men, as if ignorant.
He who instructs in an unlawful manner, and he who asks in an unlawful manner,—of those two one or the other either dies (untimely), or incurs the ill-will (of the people).
Where merit and wealth are not possible, nor is there an adequate desire to serve, there knowledge should not be imparted; just as healthy seed (is not sown) on barren land.
The expounder of the Veda may rather perish along with his knowledge; hut he should never sow it on barren soil, even in dike distress.
Learning having approached the Brāhmaṇa said to him—“I am thy wealth, guard me; impart me not unto a scorner; thus may I become extremely powerful.”
“Expound me unto the Brāhmaṇa who guards his treasures and is never careless,—and whom thou knowest to be pure, self-controlled and a duly qualified student.”
He, who may acquire Veda, without his permission, from one who is reciting it, becomes corrupted with the sin of stealing the Veda, and falls into hell.
One should first salute him from whom he receives knowledge, either temporal or scriptural or spiritual.
Better the Brāhmaṇa knowing the Sāvitrī alone, if he is thoroughly self-controlled,—and not he who knows all the three Vedas, but is not self-controlled, and eats all things and sells all things.
One should not sit with a superior upon the couch or seat prepared for him. and if he himself should happen to be seated on a couch or skat, he should rise to meet (the superior) and salute him.
On the elder approaching, the vital breaths of the younger rush outward; and he recovers them by the acts of rising to meet and salute him.
For one who is in the habit of saluting and constantly revering elders,—four things prosper: viz ., longevity, merit, fame and strength.
The Brāhmaṇa, when greeting an elder, should, after the accosting, pronounce his name, (saying) “this here, I am named so and so,”
To those persons who do not comprehend the (significance of the) name (pronounced) in the words of greeting, the wise one should say ‘I’; similarly to all, women.
In saluting, one should pronounce the term “Oh, Sir” at the end op his own name; since it has been declared by the sages that the form “Oh, Sir” represents the form of all names.
On saluting, the Brāhmaṇa should he answered with the words ‘Be long lived, O Gentle One’; and at the end of his name the vowel “a,” which occurs at the end of the consonant, should be pronounced ultra long.
The Brāhmaṇa who knows not the return-greeting of the greeting of salutation does not deserve to be saluted by the learned; he is exactly as the śūdra is.
Having met a Brāhmaṇa, one should ask him his “welfare,” a Kṣatriya his “freedom from distemper,” a Vaiśya his “prosperity,” and a Shudra his “freedom from disease.”
A person who has been initiated (for a rite), even though he be younger, should not be addressed by name; one who knows the law should address him beginning with such terms as “sir” and “your worship.”
A female who is the wife of another person, and is not related to one by birth, should be addressed as “Lady,” and also “blessed,” or “sister.”
One should rise and say ‘here (so and so) I am,’ to such maternal uncles, paternal uncles, fathers-in-law and superiors as happen to be younger.
Mother’s sister, maternal uncle’s wife, mother-in-law, and father’s sister deserve to re honoured like the teacher’s wife; all these are equal to the wife of the Teacher.
The brother’s wife, if of the same caste, should be clasped in the feet day by day; but the wives of other paternal, maternal and other relatives should be so clasped only when one has gone on a journey.
Towards his father’s sister, his mother’s sister, and his own elder sister, one should adopt the same behaviour as towards his mother; but the mother is more venerable than these.
Among citizens friendship and equality are regarded as ranging within ten years (of age-difference); among artists, it is regarded as ranging within five years; among learned men, it proceeds up to three years; and among blood-relations, it ranges only within a very short period of time.
The Brāhmaṇa or ten years and the Kṣatriya or a hundred years should be known as father and son; and of the two this Brāhmaṇa is the father.
Wealth, Relation, Age, Action and Learning, as the fifth,—these are the grounds of respect; (among them) that which follows is weightier (than that which goes before it).
Among the three (higher) castes, he, in whom there are present most op these five, and of high degree, deserves (greater) respect; as also the Śūdra who has reached the tenth stage (of life).
Way should be made for one in a chariot, for one who is in the tenth stage of life, for one suffering from disease, for one carrying a burden, for a woman, for the person who has just passed out of studentship, for the king and for the bridegroom.
Among these, when they come together, the man who has just passed his studentship and the King deserve to be honoured; and between the person just passed his studentship and the King, the person just passed his studentship receives the respects op the King.
The Brāhmana who, having initiated a pupil, teaches him the Veda along with the Ritualistic and esoteric treatises,—him they call, ‘Ācārya,’ ‘Preceptor’
He is called “Upādhyāya,” “Sub-teacher,” who teaches, for a living, only a part of the Veda, or only the Vedic subsidiary sciences.
That Brāhmaṇa, who performs, in the prescribed manner, one’s sacramental rites beginning with the rites of impregnation, and supports him with food, is called the “Guru,” “Mentor.”
He who, being duly appointed, performs, for one the Fire-laying rite, the Cooked Sacrifices and the Agniṣṭoma and other sacrifices,—is called his “officiating priest.”
He who rightly fills one’s both ears with the Veda should be regarded as his Father and Mother; one should not, at any time, do him harm.
In veneration, the Preceptor excels ten Sub-teachers; the Father a hundred preceptors, and the Mother a thousand Fathers.
Between the progenitor and the imparter of the veda, the imparter op the veda is the more venerable father; for the brāhmaṇa’s “birth” is the veda, eternally,—here as well as after death.
When the Father and Mother beget one through mutual desire,—this that he is born in the womb is to be regarded as his “production.”
But the “birth” which the Preceptor, well-versed in the Veda, brings about for him, in the lawful manner, by means of the Sāvitrī,—that is real, imperishable, immortal.
If one benefits him by means of knowledge, more or less,—him also one should regard herb as the “mentor,” by virtue of that benefit of knowledge.
The Brāhmaṇa, who brings about his Vedic birth, and teaches him his duty,—even though he be a mere child,—becomes in law the father of the old man (whom he teaches).
The child Kavi, the son of Aṅgiras, taught his fathers; and having received and trained them by knowledge, he called them “little sons.”
They, having their anger aroused, questioned the gods about this matter; and the gods, having met together, said to them—“the child has addressed you in the lawful manner.”
The ignorant person is verily a “child,” while the imparted of mantras is the “father.” They have called the ignorant man “child,” and the imparter of mantras, “father.”
Neither by years, nor by grey hair, nor by wealth, nor by relatives (is greatness attained); since the sages have made the law that ‘he who teaches is the greatest among us.’
Among Brāhmaṇas seniority is by knowledge; among Kṣatriyas by valour; and among Vaiśyas by grains and riches; among Shudras alone it is by age.
One does not become venerable by the fact that his hair has turned grey; the gods know him to be venerable who, though young, continues to study.
As the elephant made of wood, as the deer made of leather, so the non-learning Brāhmaṇa,—these three merely bear their names.
As the eunuch is useless among women, as the cow is useless among cows, as a gift to the ignorant person is useless, even so is the Bbrāhmaṇa useless who is devoid of the Veda.
Teaching for good should be imparted to living beings, without injury to them; and sweet and soft words should be employed by one who seeks for merit.
He, whose speech and mind are pure and ever properly guarded, obtains the whole reward recognised by the canons of the Veda.
Even though pained, one should not (use such words as) cut to the quick; he should not do, or think of, injury to others; he should not utter words by which others are pained, and which (therefore) will obstruct his passage to (higher) regions.
The Brāhmaṇa should ever shrink from reverence, as from poison; and he should always seek for disrespect, as for nectar.
One who is scorned sleeps in comport and wakes up in comfort and goes about in the world in comport; it is the scorner that perishes.
Sanctified in self, the twice-born man, while dwelling with his Teacher, should, by the adoption of this course, generally accumulate sanctity for the learning of the Veda.
The entire Veda, along with the Esoteric Treatises, should be learnt by the twice-born person,—by means of various kinds of austerities and observances prescribed by rule.
The best of Brāhmaṇas, desiring to acquire piety, should constantly repeat the Veda; because for the Brāhmaṇa, Veda-repeating is declared to be the highest penance on earth.
It is said that that twice-born man, who, even though garlanded, recites the Veda daily to the best of his capacity, undergoes the highest penance to his very nail-tips.
The twice-born man, who, not having learnt the veda, labours over other things, soon falls, along with his descendants, even while living, to the state of the śūdra.
According to the directions of the Revealed Word, the first birth of the twice-born man is from the mother, the second, after the Ggirdle-tying ceremony, and the third, after sacrificial initiation.
Among these, at that Brahmic birth which is. marked by the tying of the girdle, the Sāvitrī has been declared to be his “Mother,” and the Teacher his “Father.”
They call the Teacher “father,” on account of his imparting the Veda. Before the tying of the girdle, the performance of no religious act is proper for him.
He should hot pronounce Vedic texts, apart from the Svadhā-offering; because so long as he is not born in the Veda, he is equal to a śūdra.
For the boy whose initiatory rite has been performed, instruction regarding; observances is considered desirable; as also the getting up of the Veda, in due course, according to the prescribed rule.
That skin, that sac red thread, that girdle, that staff and that garment, which has been prescribed for one, stand during the observances also.
With a view to enhancing his own piety, the Rreligious Student should, while living with his Teacher, observe all these rules,—having fully subjugated all his organs.
Every day, having bathed and become clean, he should make offerings to deities, Sages and Fathers, and do the worshipping of the deities and the placing of fuel.
He should abstain from honey, meat, scent, garland, flavours, women, all fermented acids and also the killing of living creatures.
From anointing, applying collyrium to the eyes, shoes, holding the umbrella, attachment, anger, avarice, dancing, singing and playing on musical instruments.
From gambling, quarelling with people, calumniating, and also lying; prom gazing at and touching of women, and prom the injuring op others.
He should always sleep alone; nowhere should he allow his manhood to run out; by intentionally allowing his manhood to run out, hr breaks his vow.
The twice-born religious student, haying unintentionally dropped his manhood during a dream, should thrice recite the three vedic verses beginning with “punarmām,” after having bathed and worshipped the sun.
He should fetch the jar of water, flowers, cowdung, earth and kuśa-grass,—as much as may be required; and day by day he should beg for alms.
The Religious Student, being pure, should fetch alms daily from the houses of persons who are not devoid of Veda and sacrifices, and who are famed for their deeds.
He should not beg for food from his Teacher’s family; nor from the family of his paternal or maternal relations. But when other houses are not available, he should avoid the preceding in preference to the succeeding.
In the event of al the afouesaid being not available, he may wander over the whole village, remaining pure and having his speech well-controlled; but he should avoid persons of ill-repute.
Having fetched fuel-sticks from a distance, he should place them in the air; and with these he should, without fail, make offerings to the fire, morning and evening.
He who, without being ill, omits for seven days, to beg alms and to offer fuel to the fire, shall perform the rites prescribed for the Avakīrṇin.
The avowed student should subsist on alms; he should not (habitually) eat the food given by one person. for the student, subsisting on alms has been declared to be equal to fasting.
During a performance in honour of gods and in honour of ancestors, he may, when invited, eat freely, like an ascetic, in due accordance with his observances. by this his observances do not suffer.
This duty has been prescribed by the sages for the Brāhmaṇa only; this duty has not been so ordained for the Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya.
Prompted by the Teacher, or even when not prompted, he should put forth his exertion to study, and also to doing what is helpful to the teacher.
Having under control his body and his speech, as also his organs of sensation and his hind, he should stand with joined palms, looking at the face of his Teacher.
He should always have his arm raised, remain well behaved, and well-guarded; when addressed with the words “be seated,” he should sit facing his teacher.
In the peesenge of his Teacher, he should always have inferior food, dress and apparel; he should rise before him, and go to sleep later.
He should not listen to and converse with (his Teacher), while lying down; nor while seated, nor while eating, nor while standing, nor with his face turned away.
He should do (these) standing, when the teacher is seated; advancing towards him, when he is standing; going forward to him, when he advances; and running after him, when he runs;
Facing him, when the teacher has his pace averted; going near him, when the teacher is at a distance; bowing low, when the teacher is lying down, as also if he is standing close by.
When near his Teacher, his bed or seat should always be low; and within sight op his Teacher, he should not sit at ease.
Even behind the Teacher’s back, he should not pronounce his mere name; nor should he mimic his gait, speech or deportment.
Where the censuring or defaming of his Teacher is going on, there he should either close his ears, or go away thence to another place.
Through censure one becomes an ass, and the defamer becomes a dog; he who lives on him becomes a worm, and he who is jealous becomes an insect.
He should not offer his worship to the teacher while at a distance from him; nor when angry, nor near a woman. If seated upon a conveyance or a seat, he should come down and then salute him.
When sitting in the company of his teacher, uk should not sit either to the lee-ward or to the wind-ward of him; nor should he say anything beyond the hearing of his teacher.
He may sit with the teacher on carts drawn by oxen, horses and camels, on terraces and on grass-mats; as also on reedmats, rocks, benches and boats.
When the Teacher’s teacher happens to be close by, he should adopt towards him the same behaviour as towards his own teacher; but until permitted by his teacher, he should not pay respects to his own elders.
This same shall be his constant behaviour towards his intellectual teachers, towards his blood-relations, towards persons restraining him from sin and towards those who give him salutary advice.
Towards superiors he should always behave as towards the Teacher, as also towards the Teacher’s son who has acquired the position of the Teacher, and towards the Teacher’s own blood-relations.
Whether he be younger, or of equal age, or a student of sacrificial ritual,—the Teacher’s son, imparting instruction, dfserves the same honour as the Teacher.
He shall not shampoo the limbs of his teacher’s son, nor assist him in bathing, nor eat of the food left by him; nor should he wash his feet.
The teacher’s ladies belonging to the same caste should be honoured like the teacher himself; those not belonging to the same caste should be honoured with rising and salutations.
Annointing, assisting at bath, shampooing of limbs and dressing of the hair should not be done for the teacher’s wife.
The teacher’s wife, when young, shall not be saluted at her feet by a pupil who is full twenty years old, and who is conscious of what is good and what is bad.
It is the very nature of women to corrupt men. It is for this reason that the wise are never unguarded regarding women.
In this world women are capable op leading astray the ignorant, as well as the learned, who becomes a servile follower of desire and passion.
One should not sit alone with his mother, sister or daughter. The powerful host of sense-organs overpowers even the learned.
The young man may perform the proper salutation on the ground to the young wives of his Teacher,—saying “here i am.”
Having returned from a journey, he should clasp the feet of his Teacher’s wife, and daily he should salute her, bearing in mind the duty of the righteous.
Just as a man digging with the spade obtains water,—even so one who is eager to serve acquires the learning that is in the Teacher.
He may have his head shaved, or wear his hair in braids, or have only the top-hair braided. The sun should never set, nor should it rise, while he is still in the village.
If the sun should rise or set while he is still sleeping, either intentionally or unintentionally, he should fast during the day, reciting. (the Sāvitrī).
If during one’s sleep the sun has set, and if during one’s sleep the sun has risen,—if he does not perform the Expiatory Rite, he becomes tainted by grievous sin.
Having sipped water, with calm and collected mind, he shall daily attend upon the two twilights, in a clean place, reciting the mantras to be recited, according to rule.
If either a woman; or a junior person, do something good, he should faithfully perform all that; as also that in which his mind finds satisfaction.
Spiritual merit and wealth are called “good”; or pleasure and wealth; or spiritual merit alone, or wealth alone is “good”; but the truth is that it is the aggregate of the three.
The preceptor, the father, the mother and the elder brother should not be treated with disrespect, especially by a Brāhmaṇa,—even though he be distressed
The preceptor is the embodiment of Brahman; the father is the embodiment of Prajāpati; the Mother is the embodiment of the earth, and one’s own brother is the embodiment of the self.
The trouble that the parents undergo in the birth of children,—for that there can be no compensation even in a hundred years.
He should always do what is pleasing to those two and to the preceptor; on these three being satisfied, all austerity becomes completed.
The service of these three is declared to be the highest austerity; until permitted by them, one should not perform any other meritorious act.
These have been declared to be the three regions, these the three life-stages, these the three Vedas and these the three fires.
The Father has been declared to be the Gārhapatya Fire, the Mother the Dakṣiṇa Fire, and the Preceptor the Āhavanīya fire; and this Triad of fires is highly important.
The Householder who fails not towards these three would win the three regions, and rejoice in heaven, radiant in body, like a God.
He acquires this region by devotion to his Mother, the middle region by devotion to his Father, and the region of Brahman by serving his Preceptor.
All the duties have been honoured by him who has honoured these three; and all acts remain fruitless for him who does not honour them.
So long as these three live, he should not do anything else; he should always bender service unto them, rejoicing in what is pleasing and beneficial to them.
He should communicate to them by thought, word or deed whatever he may do without injury to them, for the sake of the next life.
All that ought to be done by man is finished on these three; this is the highest direct duty; every other is a subordinate duty.
One imbued with faith may acquire excellent learning even from a lowly person, special law even from the lowest, and the gem of a wife even from a base family.
Nectar mat be taken even from poison, good advice even prom a child; good conduct (may be learnt) even from a foe; and gold (mat be taken) even from an impure source.
Wives, gems, learning, virtue, purity, wise saying and the various arts may be obtained from all sources.
In abnormal times of difficulty learning from a non-Brāhmaṇa has been enjoined, as also the serving of such a teacher, in the shape of following him, during the course of study.
A pupil, desiring an unsurpassable state, shall not be in life-long residence with a non-Brāhhaṇa teacher; or with a Brāhmaṇa-teacher who is not an expounder.
If one likes to live in life-long residence in the teacher’s house, he should, intently serve him till he becomes freed from his body.
The Brāhmaṇa who, till the dissolution of his body, serves his teacher, goes forthwith to the eternal abode of brahman.
At first the pupil, knowing his duties, should not give anything to his teacher; but when going to take the final bath, he should, on being ordered by the teacher, present something for him, to the best of his capacity;
Joyfully bringing to the teacher, a field, or gold, or a cow, or a horse, or at least an umbrella and a fair of shoes, grain, vegetables or clothes.
The Preceptor having died, he should serve, in the same manner as the Preceptor, the qualified son of the Preceptor, or the Preceptor’s wife, or his Sapiṇḍa.
When all these are non-existent, he should perfect his body, while he carries on the tending of the Fire, with only such diversions as standing and sitting.
The Brāhmaṇa who thus keeps his studentship unflinchingly, goes to the highest place and is never born again into this world.
Duties relating to the Three Vedas should be observed under the Preceptor for thirty-six years, or for half that period, or for a quarter, or precisely till they have been got up.
Having learnt, in due course, three Vedas, or two Vedas, or one Veda, he should enter upon the state of the householder, having never deviated from the vows of studentship.
When, by the due observance of his duties, he has acquired the Veda and his heritage from his father, and is so inclined,—his father shall first honour him, adorned with garlands and seated upon a couch, with the “Cow.”
The twice-born person, having, on being permitted by the Preceptor, “bathed” and “returned” according to rule, shall take a wife of the same caste as himself, who is endowed with signs.
She who is not a “sapiṇḍa” of one’s mother, not of the same “Gotra” as his Father, and who is not born of (unlawful) intercourse—has been recommended for marriage.
   
In female connection one should avoid these (following) ten families,—even though they be great and rich in the possession of cattle, goat and sheep and grain.
Such families as that in which the sacred rites have been abandoned, which is male-less, which is devoid of the Veda, members of which are woolly and subject to piles, phthisis, dyspepsia, epilepsy, leucoderma, and leprosy.
He should hot marry a maiden with tawny hair, nor one with superfluous limbs, nor one who has disease, nor one who has either no hair or too much hair, nor one who is garrulous, nor one with reddish eyes.
Nor one bearing the name of an asterism, or a tree, or a river; nob one having her hame after a low caste or a mountain; nor one named after a bird, a serpent or a slave; nor one with a hame inspiring terror.
One should marry a female with a faultless body, bearing an agreeable name, having her gait like that of the swan or the elephant, having fine hair on the body and the head, and fine teeth, and with tender limbs.
The wise man shall not mabry one who has no brother, or whose father is not known; for fear of her having the character of the “appointed daughter.”
For ‘twice-born men’ a girl of equal caste has been recommended for the first marriage-sacrament. For those, however, who take to it through mere desire, these (following) should be regarded as preferable in due order.
For the Śūdra, the Śūdra girl. alone has been ordained to be the wife; for the Vaiśya, she as also the girl of his own caste; for the Kṣatriya, those two as also the girl of his own caste; and for the Brāhmaṇa those three as also the girl of his own caste
Under no circumstance whatsoever has a Śūdra wife been ordained for the Brāhmaṇa and the Kṣatriya,—even though these be placed in peril.
Twice-born men, marrying, through infatuation, a girl of the low caste, quickly reduce their families, along with their offspring, to the position of the Śūdra.
One who marries a Śūdra girl becomes an outcastk,—according to atri and to the son of Utathya; according to Śaunaka, by the birth of a son; and according to Bhṛgu, by having children from her (alone).
Having placed a Śūdrā woman on his bed, the Brāhmaṇa goes to perdition; and having begotten a son by her, he falls from Brāhmaṇahood itself.
If the rites performed by one in honour of deities, Pitṛs and Guests are dominated by her (his Śūdra wife), then the Pitṛs and the Gods do not eat of them; and the man does not go to heaven.
There is ho expiation for him who has drunk the moisture of the mouth of a Śūdra woman, who has been tainted by her breath, and who has begotten children on her.
Understand briefly these (following) eight forms of marriage of girls, among the four castes,—which are beneficial and not-beneficial here (in this life) and also after death.
The Brāhma, the Daiva, the Ārṣa, the Prājāpatya, the Āsura, the Gāndharva, the Rākṣasa and the Paiśāca, which is the eighth and the lowest.
Which (of these) is lawful for which caste, what are the good and bad points of each, the good and bad effects of each upon the offspring,—all this I shall explain to you.
One should know the first six in the order stated as lawful for the Brāhmaṇa, the last four for the Kṣatriya and those same, excepting the “Rākṣasa,” for the Vaiśya and the Śūdra.
The wise ones have regarded the first four as commended for the Brāhmaṇa, the Rākṣasa alone for the Kṣatriya and the Āsura for the Vaiśva and the Śūdra.
Of the five, three have been declared to be lawful and two unlawful, in this treatise; the Paiśāca and the Āsura forms should never be adopted.’
The two forms of marriage mentioned before— i.e. , the Gāndharva and the Rākṣasa—have been declared, whether separately or mixed, to be lawful for the Kṣatriya.
When one himself invites a man endowed with learning and character and gives to him his daughter, after having dressed and worshipped (them),—this is called the “Brāhma” form.
While a sacrifice is being performed, if one gives away his daughter, after having decked her, to the priest who is officiating at it,—this they call the “Daiva” form.
‘When the maiden is given away in due accordance with rule, after taking, in odedience to law, from the bridegroom, one or two pairs of cow and bull,—this is called the “Ārṣa” form.’
When the Father, having decked them, gives away the daughter with the words, “may you both together perform your duty,” making them also repeat them,—this is called the “Prājāpatya” form.
When one carries away the maiden, after having given, of his own will, as much wealth as the (he?) can to the kinsmen, as well as to the bride herself, this is called the “Āsura” form.
The mutual union of the bride and bridegroom, through love is to be known as the “Gāndharva” form; it has sexual intercourse for its end and it has its source in lust.
The forcible abduction of the maiden from her home, while she is crying out and weeping, after having beaten and wounded and pierced,—is called the “Rākṣasa” form.
When the man approaches the girl by stealth, while she is asleep, or intoxicated or unconscious,—it is the “Paiśāca” form, the wickedest and the basest of marriages.
‘For the chief of twice-born men the giving away of one’s daughter with water alone is commended; but for the other castes it is with mutual desire.’
The quality that has been ascribed by Manu to each of these forms of marriage—listen to all that, O Brāhmaṇas, from me, as I proceed to describe them correctly.
The son born of the wife married by the Brāhma form is a performer of righteous acts, absolves from sins ten Pitṛs on the ascending side and ten on the descending side of his family, as also himself as the twenty-first.
The son born of the wife married by the Daiva form (absolves from sin) seven ancestors and seven des cendants; the son born of the wife married by the Ārṣa form three of each; and the son born of the wife married by the Prājāpatya form six of each.
Only from the four marriages mentioned successively, beginning with the Brāhma, are born sons endowed with Brahmic glory and respected by cultured persons.
Endowed with beauty and the quality of goodness, possessing wealth, and fame, with full enjoyment and righteous, they live for a hundred years.
From the other remaining inferior marriages are born sons, addicted to saying harsh and untrue words, and despisers of the Vedic Dharma.
From unblamable marriages unblamable offspring is born to men; and from blameworthy marriages blameworthy child. One should therefore avoid the blamable marriages.
In the case of girls of the same caste (as the bridegroom) the sacramental rite of “taking the hand” has been prescribed; and in that of the marriage of girls of different castes, this (following) should be known as the right procedure.
When being married to a man of higher caste, the Kṣatriya girl should take hold of the arrow, the Vaiśya girl of the goad and the Śūdra girl of the hem of the garment.
One should observe the rule of approaching (one’s wife) during the period of her season,—ever attached to his own wife. In consideration of her he may approach her with a desire for sexual intercourse, except on the sacred days.
Sixteen days, including the four days that are censured by good men, have been declared to be the normal “season” for women.
Of these the first four days have been deprecated, as also the eleventh and the thirteenth, the remaining ten days have been recommended.
On the even days male children are conceived, and female ones on the uneven days; therefore one who desires a son should have recourse to ones wife on the even days of her “season.”
A male child is born when the man’s seed is in excess, and a female child when the woman’s (is in excess); when the two are equal, there is born either a non-male or a boy and a girl; when it is weak and small in quantity, there is failure.
‘By avoiding women on the forbidden days and also on the eight other days, one remains a “religious student” (observing the vow of continence), in whatever stage of life he may happen to be.”
The girl’s father, if wise, should not accept even a small consideration; by accepting a consideration, through greed, the man becomes a child-seller.
Those relations who, through folly, live upon the bride’s properties—even the bride’s conveyances and clothes—are sinners and fall into the lowest state.
Some people declare that the bovine pair are the “consideration” (to be accepted) in the Ārṣa form of marriage. This is not true; for small or large, the act becomes a ‘selling’ all the same.
In the case of girls whose relations do not appropriate the bride’s gift, it is not “selling;” It is only a means of honouring the maidens and is entirely harmless.
These shall be honoured and adorned by their fathers and brothers, husbands and brothers-in-law, who are desirous of their own welfare.
Where women are honoured, there the gods rejoice; where, on the other hand, they are not honoured, there all rites are fruitless.
Where the female relations live in grief, the family soon wholly perishes; but that family where they are not unhappy ever prospers.
The houses on which female relations, not being duly honoured, pronounce a curse, perish completely, as if destroyed by magic.
Hence men who seek (their own) welfare, should always honour women on holidays and festivals with (gifts of) ornaments, clothes, and (dainty) food.
In that family, where the husband is pleased with his wife and the wife with her husband, happiness will assuredly be lasting.
For if the wife is not radiant with beauty, she will not attract her husband; but if she has no attractions for him, no children will be born.
If the wife is radiant with beauty, the whole house is bright; but if she is destitute of beauty, all will appear dismal.
By low marriages, by omitting (the performance of) sacred rites, by neglecting the study of the Veda, and by irreverence towards Brahmanas, (great) families sink low.
By (practising) handicrafts, by pecuniary transactions, by (begetting) children on Sudra females only, by (trading in) cows, horses, and carriages, by (the pursuit of) agriculture and by taking service under a king.
By sacrificing for men unworthy to offer sacrifices and by denying (the future rewards for good) works, families, deficient in the (knowledge of the) Veda, quickly perish.
( Note: the following is an alternate translation by George Bühler )
In the marriage-fire the householder should perform the ‘gṛhya’ rites; as also the rite of the ‘five sacrifices’ and the daily cooking.
For the householder there are five slaughter-houses: the hearth, the grinding-stone, household implements, mortar and pestle and water-jar;—by using which he becomes stricken.
For the purpose of expiating all these in their course, the five great sacrifices have been ordained by the great sages, for householders (to be performed) daily.
Teaching is the ‘offering to Brahma;’ the Tarpaṇa is the ‘offering to Pitṛs;’ the Homa is ‘offering to Gods;’ the Bali is ‘offering to elementals;’ and the honouring of Guests is ‘offering to men.’
He who omits not these sacrifices, to the best of his capacity, on any day, does not become tainted by the sin of the ‘slaughter-house,’ even though living in the house.
He who does not make offerings to the five— viz ., gods, guests, dependents, Pitṛs and himself,—does not live, even though breathing.
‘They also call these five sacrifices “Ahuta,” “Huta,” “Prahuta,” “Brāhmya-huta,” and “Prāśita.”’
Japa is ‘Ahuta,’ Offering into fire is ‘Huta,’ Offering to elementals is ‘Prahuta,’ The honouring of Brāhmaṇas is ‘Brāhmya-huta,’ and Water-offering to Pitṛs is ‘Prāśita.’
One should be constantly engaged in Vedic Study, as also in acts in honour of the gods; one who is engaged in acts in honour of the gods upholds the world, moveable as well as immoveable.
An oblation duly thrown into the fire reaches the sun; from the sun proceeds rain from, rain food, and from food, the creatures.
Just as all Creatures subsist by deriving support from air, so do the other states subsist by deriving support from the Housohelder.
Because men in all the three states are sustained by householders only, with knowledge and food, therefore the householder’s is the highest state.
That state, which cannot be maintained by men with weak organs, should be kept up with care by one desiring imperishable heaven and also undying happiness in this world.
Sages, Pitṛs, gods, elementals and guests have expectations from family-men; one who knows should fulfil (one’s duty) towards them.’
One should worship, according to law, the Sages by Vedic Study, the Gods by Homa-offerings, the Pitṛs by Śrāddha offerings, the Men by food and the Elementals by the offering of Bali.’
One should daily offer Śrāddha with food, or with water, or with milk, roots and fruits,—(thereby) bringing pleasure to the Pitṛs.
At that (Śrāddha) which forms part of the Five Sacrifices, one should feed even one Brāhmaṇa in honour of the pitṛs; and on this occasion he shall not feed any Brāhmaṇa in honour of the Viśve-devas.
Out of the food cooked in the domestic fire, for the Viśvedevas, the Brāhmaṇa shall every day offer, according to rule, Homa to these deities,’
First to Agni and to Soma, then to both these together, then to the Viśve-devas and to Dhanvantari.
To Kuhū, to Anumati, and to Prajāpati; then to Dyauḥ—Pṛthivī jointly, and finally to Sviṣṭakṛt,’
Having thus duly offered the oblation into fire, he should place Bali-offerings in all directions, proceeding towards his right to Indra, Antaka, Ap-pati and Indu, along with their followers.
Saying “this to the Maruts,” he should make an offering at the door; also one in water, saying, “this to the Apas;” and he should hake an offering on the pestle and mortar, saying, “this to the Vanaspatis.”
He should hake an offering to Śrī on the “head” and to Bhadrakālī on the “feet;” for Brahman and Vāstoṣpati, he should place an offering in the centre of the homestead.
The offering to the Viśvedevas he should throw into the sky; as also to the Elementals roaming in the day and to those roaming at night.
These offerings one should make in the upper dwelling, for the purpose of acquiring all kinds of food. The entire remnant of the offerings he should offer towards the South, to the pitṛs.
He should gently place on the ground food for dogs, outcasts, Cāṇḍālas, persons afflicted with filthy diseases, birds and insects.
The Brāhmaṇa who thus daily honours all beings, becomes endowed with a body of light, and goes to the highest place, by the straight path.
Having performed this rite of offerings, he should first feed his guest and then give alms in the proper form, to one who is mendicant and a ‘Brahmacārin’
The twice-born householder, giving alms, obtains the same reward for merit which reward for merit one obtains by giving a cow, in the proper form, to his Teacher.
In accordance with scriptural injunctions, one should make over to the Brāhmaṇa knowing the true meaning of the Veda even alms and a water-put, after having honoured him.
Rites in honour of the gods and those in honour of the Pitṛs performed by ignorant men become lost, when they are presented by the givers, through folly, to ash-like Brāhmaṇas.
An oblation thrown into the mouth-fire of Brāhmaṇas, effulgent with learning and austerities, saves from trouble, and also from great sin.
To the guest that has happened to come, he should offer; according to rule, water and seat, and also food prepared to the best of his abilitv.
A Brāhmaṇa staying unhonoured (in one’s house) takes away all his merit, even though he be one who subsists by gathering harvest-droppings, or offers oblations into the five fires.
Grasses, place, water and kind word as the fourth,—even these never fail in the house of good people.
A Brāhmaṇa staying for a single night has been declared to be a “guest” (Atithi). Because his stay is not long, therefore he is called “Atithi” (guest).
One should not regard as “guest” a Brāhmaṇa who lives in the same village or who is a companion. He should regard him as such when he arrives at his house, or where the wife and the fires are at the time.
Those foolish householders who wait upon the food cooked by others, become, after death, on that account, cattle belonging to the givers of food.
The guest brought by the sun in the evening should not be driven away by the house-holder. Arrived in time, or not in time, he shall not stay in his house without taking food.
He himself should not eat what he does not offer to his guest. The honouring of guests is conducive to wealth, fame, longevity and heaven.
He should offer seat, room, bed, foliowing and attendance of the best kind to superiors, of the inferior kind to inferiors and of the equal (ordinary) kind to equals.
On the Vaiśvadeva having been finished, if another guest should happen to arrive,—for him also he should provide food to the best of his ability; but he shall not make any offering (out of that food).
A Brāhmaṇa should not advertise his family and Gotra for the purpose of obtaining a meal. Bragging about these, for the purpose of obtaining a meal, he comes to be called a “feeder on filth” by the wise.
In a Brāhmaṇa’s house, the Kṣatriya is not called a ‘guest;’ nor the Vaiśya or the Śūdra, nor his friends or relations, or his Teacher.
If a Kṣatriya should happen to come to one’s house in the character of a guest, one may feed him also, after the Brāhmaṇas have eaten.
The Vaiśya and the Śūdra also, when arrived in the family in the character of guests, he should feed, along with his servants,—showing his compassionate disposition.
Others also, friends and the rest, that may come to his house out of affection, he should feed on food specially prepared, to the best of his ability, together with his wife.
Newly married girls, maidens, sick persons and pregnant women,—these he should, without hesitation, feed immediately after the guests.
The foolish man, who eats before giving food to these, does not understand, that, in thus eating, he is himself devoured by dogs and vultures.
After the Brāhmaṇas, his own people and servants have dined,—the husband and wife should afterwards eat what is left.
Having worshipped the gods, sages, men, the Pitṛs and the household deities, the Householder shall eat afterwards what remains.
He who cooks for himself eats only sin; for the eating of good mem has been described as the eating of the remains of sacrifices.
He should receive, with the “honey-mixture,” the king, the priest, the accomplished Student, the Teacher, the Son-in-law, the Father-in-law and the Maternal uncle,—coming again after a year.
The king and the Learned Man should be honoured with the Honey-mixture, at the approach of a sacrificial performance,—not if there is no sacrifice (going to be performed).
Out of the food cooked in the evening the wife should offer the Bali-oblation, without sacred formulas. This is the “Vaiśvadeva” rite which has been enjoined for both Morning and evening.
Month after Month, on the moonless day, the Brāhmaṇa with the Fire shall, after having performed the Pitṛyajña, offer the “Piṇḍānvāhāryaka.”
The monthly śrāddha to the Pitṛs the wise call “anvāhārya;” and it should be carefully performed with such meat as has been commended.
I am now going to describe fully which and how many Brāhmaṇas should be fed at it, and on what food,—as also those that should be avoided.
Even though wealthy, one should feed two at the rite performed in honour of the gods, and three at that in honour of the Pitṛs; or one only at each of the two rites he should not indulge in large company.
Respectful treatment, place and time, purity and the qualities of Brāhmaṇas,—a large company hampers these five; therefore one shall not seek a large company.
This rite named “Pitrya,” performed on the Moonless Day is known as beneficial to the dead. To him who is intent on performing it, there always accrues benefit after death, offered according to human ordinances.
Food offered to the gods and that offered in the Pitṛs are to be given to the most deserving; Brāhmaṇa learned in the Vedas. What is given to him is conducive to great results.
By feeding at least one learned brāhmaṇa each at the rite performed in honour of the gods and that performed in honour of the ancestors,—one obtains a full reward; and not by feeding even many men ignorant of the Veda.’
From far off one should examine the Brāhmaṇa thoroughly versed in the Veda; such a one is the proper channel for offerings to gods and Pitṛ and in the matter of gifts he has been declared to be the guest.
Where one thousand persons ignorant of the Veda eat, all those a single man learned in the Veda, on being satisfied, absorbs, in point of merit.
Offerings for gods and Pitṛs should be given to one who is distinguished by knowledge; for hands smeared with blood are not cleansed by blood.
As many mouthfuls as the person ignorant of the Veda swallows out of the offerings to gods and Pitṛs, so many flaming spikes, spears and iron-balls does the man swallow after death.
Some twice-born persons excel in learning; others excel in austerities; some others excel in austerities and Vedic study, and others again excel in rites.
The offerings to the pitṛs should be carefully presented to those excelling in learning; and the offerings to gods to all the four, according to law.
If a father happen to be ignorant of the Veda, whose son is thoroughly versed in the Veda,—and if the son happen to be ignorant of the Veda and the father is t horoughly versed in the Veda;
‘Of these two one should regard him as superior whose father is learned in the Veda; while the other deserves honour for the sake of the veneration due to the Veda.
At a Śrāddha one should not feed a friend; his acquisition shall be made by means of riches. At a Śrāddha one should feed him whom he regards neither as friend nor as foe.
He at whose Śrāddhas and sacrifices, the friend forms the principal factor,—for him, after death, there is no reward, either for Śrāddhas or for sacrifices.
The man who, through folly, makes friendships by means of Śrāddhas,—that meanest of twice-born men, having the Śrāddha for his friend, falls from the regions of heaven.
This convivial dinner has been called by twice-born people the “gift of devils.” It remains in this world alone, like the blind cow tied in a single room.
Just as having sown the seed in barren soil, the sower reaps no harvest,—even so, having given the offerings to one ignorant of the Veda, the giver obtains no reward.
The presenting of the gift, according to rule, to the learned makes the givers and receivers partakers of reward, here as well as after death.
One may entertain a friend at Śrāddhas, but never a foe, even though qualified. The offering eaten by the enemy becomes futile after death.
With great care one should feed at a Śrāddha the adherent of the Ṛgveda who is thoroughly versed in his Veda, or the adherent of the Yajurveda who has finished the entire recensional text, or the adherent of the Sāmaveda who has reached the end of it.
If any one of these should dine, duly honoured, at the Śrāddha performed by a certain person, there would be ever-lasting satisfaction for his ancestors, lasting till the seventh degree (of descendants).
This is the first course to be adopted in the presenting of the offerings made to Gods and Pitṛs. This (following) is to be regarded as the secondary course always adopted by the good.’
One may feed the maternal grandfather, the maternal uncle, the sister’s son, father-in-law, the teacher, the daughter’s son, the son-in-law, a relative, the priest and him at whose sacrifices the performer officiates.
At the rite in honour of the gods, the man knowing the law shall not examine the Brāhmaṇa. But when the rite in honour of the Pitṛs comes to be performed, he shall examine him carefullv.
Manu has declared those Brāhmaṇas undeserving of (receiving) the offerings to gods and Pitṛs who are thieves, outcasts and eunuchs, as also those that have the behaviour of atheists.
One should not feed, at a Śrāddha, one with braided hair, who is not learned, one who is hairless, the gambler, and those who sacrifice for hosts.
Healers, temple-attendants, meat-sellers and those living by trade,—these should be avoided at rites performed in honour of gods and Pitṛs.
The servant of a village and of the king, one with deformed nails, one with black teeth, the opposer of his superior, one who has forsaken the Fire and the usurer.
The invalid, the cattle-tender, one who has superseded h is elder brother, he who neglects the Great Sacrifices, one who is inimical to Brāhmaṇas, he who has been superseded by his younger brother, and one who is member of a company.
An actor, one who has broken the vows of continence, the husband of a Śūdra woman, the son of a re-married woman, one who has only one eye, and he in whose house lives the paramour.
One who teaches for a stipulated fee, he who is taught by one who teaches for a stipulated fee, the pupil and also the teacher of a Śūdra, one who is reprehensible in speech, the son of an adulteress and the son of a widow.
The forsaker, without cause, of his mother, father and superior; and he who has formed a connection, through the relationship of either Veda or marriage, with outcasts.
The house-burner, the poisoner, one who eats the food of an adulteress’ son, the seller of Soma, the sea-voyager, the bard, the dealer in oils, and the perjuror.
One quarrelling with one’s father, the keeper of a gambling house, the drunkard, one afflicted with a foul disease, one accused of sins, the hypocrite, and the dealer in essence.
The maker of bows and arrows, he whose wife dallies with another person and he who makes love to his brother’s widow, he who injures a friend, he who subsists by gambling and he who has his own son for his teacher.
An epileptic, one having a string of scrofulous swellings, one who suffers from leucoderma, the backbiter, the lunatic, the blind man, and the derider of the Veda—all these should be avoided.
The tamer of elephants, bulls, horses or camels, one who subsists on stars, bird-keeper and the teacher of warfare.
He who diverts water-courses, he who is addicted to obstructing them, the house-planner, the messenger and
He who sports with dogs, the falconer, the defiler of virgins, the cruel man, he who derives his subsistence from Śūdras, and he who sacrifices to the Gaṇas.
One devoid of right conduct, the man without vigour, the constant beggar, he who lives by agriculture, one suffering from elephantiasis, and he who is spoken ill of by good men.
The sheep-dealer, the buffalo-keeper, the husband of a woman who had another previous husband, the carrier of the dead—all these should be avoided with care.
The learned Brāhmaṇa should avoid at both (rites) these l owest of twice-born men, who are of reprehensible conduct and who are unworthy of company.
The unlearned Brāhmaṇa becomes quenched in the same manner as the fire of dry grass. The sacrificial offering should not be presented to him; as no libation is poured upon ashes.
I am going to describe fully the results that afterwards accrue to the giver from giving, out of the offering to gods and to Pitṛs, to one who is unworthy of the line.
Demons indeed consume the food that is eaten by Brāhmaṇas deviod of self-restraint, by such as those who have superseded their elder brother and the like, or by others that are unworthy of company.
He who unites himself with “wife” and “Agnihotra,” while his elder remains, is to be regarded as the “superseder of his elder;” and the elder is to be regarded as “one who is superseded.”’
The superseded elder brother, the superseding younger brother, and she through whom the superseding is done,—all these go to hell, along with the giver and the officiating priest as the fifth.
He who would lasciviously make love to the wife of his dead brother, even though she may have been appointed according to law (to bear a child by him), should be known as the “didhiṣūpati.”
By the wives of other men two kinds of sons are born: the “Kuṇḍa” and the “Golaka;” he who is born while the husband is alive is the “Kuṇḍa,” and one born after the death of the husband is the “Golaka.”
These creatures, born of other men’s wives, cause, for the giver, the destruction, in this life as well as after death, of their offerings to gods and pitṛs that have been presented to them.
If one who is unworthy of company happen to look upon a number of those that are worthy of company, while those are eating, then the foolish giver (of food) does not obtain the reward of feeding so many men.
The blind man, by looking, destroys the feeder’s reward for feeding ninety men, the one-eyed man of sixty, the leper of one hundred, and the man afflicted with a foul disease of a thousand.
As many Brāhmaṇas the officiator at the sacrifices performed by Śūdras may happen to touch with his limbs,—the reward relating to charity in connection with the gift to so many Brāhmaṇas fails to accrue to the giver.
If a Brāhmaṇa, though learned in the Veda, should, through covetousness, accept a gift from him,—he quickly perishes; just like the unbaked vessel in water.
What is given to the Soma-seller becomes ordure; to the physician, pus and blood; that to the temple-attendant becomes lost; and that to the usurer has no place.
That which is given to the trader is neither here nor there. Similarly, what is given to the Brāhmaṇa born of a remarried woman is like a libation poured on ashes.
The wise ones declare that food given to the other unfit persons unworthy of company, described above, becomes fat, blood, flesh, marrow and bone.
Now listen to the full description of those chief of twice-born men, the sanctifiers of company, by which best of the twice-born a company defiled by men unworthy of company becomes purified.
Those persons should be known as “sanctifiers of company” who are foremost in all the vedas and in all the explanatory sciences, and who are born in the family of men learned in the veda.
One who has learnt the “Triṇāciketa,” one who knows the science of the five fires, one who has learnt the “Trisuparṇa,” one who knows the six-limbed science, one who is born of a woman married in the “Brahma (Brāhma)” form, one who sings the Jyeṣṭha-sāmas.
He who understands the meaning of the Veda, he who expounds it, the Student, the giver of a thousand, the centenarian;—these Brāhmaṇas should be known as “Sanctifiers of Company.”
When the śrāddha-performance has approaohed, one should invite, either on the preceding day or the next day, in the proper manner, at least three brāhmaṇas, such as have been described.
The brāhmaṇa invited at a rite in honor of Pitṛs shall remain self-controlled and shall not recite the Veda; so also the man who performs the śrāddha.
The Pitṛs attend upon those invited Brāhmaṇas; like the wind, they follow them and sit down when they are seated.
The rest of Brāhmaṇas, who, when duly invited at the rite in honour of Gods and Pitṛs, happens, somehow, to neglect it, incurs sin and becomes a hog.’
If the man invited at the śrāddha dallies with a woman, he takes upon himself all the sin that there may be in the giver.
The Pitṛs are the foremost gods, free from anger, ever intent on purity, chaste, rid of all means of offence, and supremely blessed.
Now fully learn from whom all these have their origin and who are to be worshipped, by whom and by what roles.
Of Manu, the son of Hiraṇyagarbha, Marīci and the rest were sons; and the sons of all these sages have been declared to constitute the “Body of Pitṛs.”
The Somasads, the sons of Virāj, have been declared to be the Pitṛs of the Sādhyas; and the Agnisvāttas, the sons of Marīci, are famed in the world as the Pitṛs of the Gods.
The Barhisads, the sons of Atri, are declared to be the Pitṛs of Daityas, Dānavas, Yakṣas, Gandharvas, Uragas, Rākṣasas, Suparṇas and Kinnaras.
Those by name Somapās are the Pitṛs of Brāhmaṇas; the Havirbhujs are the Pitṛs of Kṣatriyas; those by name Ājyapas, of Vaiśyas; and of Śūdras, Sukālins.
Somapas are the sons of Kavi; Haviṣmats are the sons of Aṅgiras; Ājyapās are the sons of Pulastya, and Sukālins, of Vaśiṣṭha.
‘The Anagnidagdhas, the Agnidagdhas, the Kāvyas, the Barhiṣads, the Agniṣvāttas, and the Saumyas,—these one should regard as the Pitṛs of Brāhmaṇas.
Of the principal bodies of Pitṛs that have been described, know that there are endless sons and grandsons in this world.
From the sages were born the Pitṛs, Gods and Men; and from the gods the entire world, moveable and immoveable, in due order.
Even water offered to these with faith, in vessels, either made of silver or connected with silver, is conducive to imperishability.
For twice-born men, the rite in honour of the Pitṛs excels that in honour of the gods; the rite in honour of the gods has been declared to be the previous sustainer of the rite in honour of the Pitṛs.
One should first engage the Brāhmaṇa in honour of the gods, as a protection to these (offerings to) Pitṛs; for the Rākṣasas take away the śrāddha that is devoid of protection.
One should first engage the Brāhmaṇa in honour of the gods, as a protection to these (offerings to) Pitṛs; for the Rākṣasas take away the śrāddha that is devoid of protection.
One should prepare with care a clean and secluded place Sloping towards the south, and smear it with cowdung.
The Pitṛs are always pleased with what is offered in clean places, on water-banks and in secluded places.
Seats with kuśa grass having been separately placed, he should seat the said Brāhmaṇas who have performed their ablutions.
Having seated those unreproached Brāhmaṇas on those seats, he should worship them with sweet-smelling perfumes and Garlands, beginning with those invited in honour of the gods.
Having presented to them water, and also sesamum along with kuśa-blade, the Brāhmaṇa, permitted by the Brāhmaṇas collectively, should make an offering into fire.
Having at fir st brought about the satisfaction of Agni and Soma-Yama by the offering of sacrificial food, he should afterwards satisfy, according to rule, the Pitṛs.
In the absence of Fire, he shall make the offering into the Brāhmaṇa’s hand; for it has been declared by the Brāhmaṇa seers of Vedic texts that what the Fire is, that same is the Brāhmaṇa.
The ancients describe these good Brāhmaṇas as the “Gods of Śrāddha,” free from anger, easily satisfied, intent upon sustaining the universe.
Having done the entire serial performance in Fire, in the “Apasavya” form, he should offer water on the ground with the hand in the “Apasavya” position.
Having made these balls out of the remnant of the said sacrificial material, he should, with collected mind and facing the South, offer them in the manner of the water-libations.
Self-controlled, he should, after having offered those balls on Kuśa-blades, according to rule, wipe that hand on those same (Kuśa-blades), for the sake of the “Partakers of Smearings.”
Turning to the north, having sipped water and having gently suppressed his breath three times, he shall salute, with proper formulas, the six seasons and also the Pitṛs.
The remaining water he should gently pour near the balls; and with collected mind he should smell those halls in the order in which they were offered.
Having, in due order of sequence, taken very small portions out of the halls, he shall first feed those same seated Brāhmaṇas with them, in accordance with role.
While his father holds, one should make the offering to the previous ancestors; or, he may feed his own father at the Śrāddha as a Brāhmana.
He whose father is dead, but grandfather is living, should mention the great-grandfather after having pronounced the name of the father.
Manu has declared that either the grandfather may eat at that Śrāddha, or the man himself may, according to his will, perform it, after being permitted by him.
Having poured into their hands water and sesamum along with kuśa blades, he should offer the top portion of the ball, saying “May this be svadhā to these.”
Taking up with his hands the supply of food, he shall himself gently place it near the Brāhmaṇas, thinking of his Pitṛs (all the time).
The wicked-minded demons forcibly destroy that food which is abandoned by both hands.
Pure and with collected mind, he shall first place on the ground the accessories, such as soups and vegetaui.es, &c., milk, curd, butter and honey.
Also hard food and soft food of various kinds, roots, fruits, savoury meat and sweet-smelling drinks.
Having gently brought up all this, he shall, with collected mind and pure, serve it,—describing all its qualities.
Never should he shed tears; nor should he become angry; nor tell a lie. He should not touch the food with his foot, nob shake it.
Tears make the food go to ghosts, anger to enemies, lie to dogs, touching with the foot to demons, and shaking to sinners.
Whatever may be agreeable to the Brāhmaṇas, that he shall give ungrudgingly. He shall relate stories told in the Veda; as this is liked by the Pitṛs.
At the rite in honour of the Pitṛs, one should recite the Vedic text, Legal Institutes, Stories, Histories, Legends and supplementary Texts.
Being happy himself, he shall bring delight to the Brāhmaṇas; he shall feed them, gently and slowly, with dishes, and urge them repeatedly by means of seasonings.
At a śrāddha he should, with special care, feed the daughter’s son, even though he be still under vows (of studentship). He should offer the blanket as seat and scatter sesamum on the ground.
Three things are sacred at Śrāddhas—the daughter’s son, blanket and sesamum, and they commend three things in this connection—cleanliness, absence of anger and absence of haste.
All the food should be very hot, and they should eat with controlled speech; when asked by the giver, the Brāhmaṇas should not describe the qualities of the sacrificial food.
As long as the food is steaming, as long as they eat with speech controlled, so long do the Pitṛs eat, as long as the qualities of the food are not described.
What the guest eats with his head wound up, what he eats with his face towards the south, what he eats with shoes on, all this verily the demons eat.
The Cāṇdāla, the pig, the cock, as also the dog, the unclean woman and the eunuch should not look at the Brāhmaṇas while eating.
At the offering into Fire, at gifts, at feeding, or at any rite in honour of the Gods or of the Pitṛs,—whatever is seen by these goes wrong.
The pig defiles by sniffing, the cock by wind raised by its wings, the dog by casting his eye, and the man born of the low caste by touch.
The cripple, or the one-eyed man, the man without a limb, or the man with a redundant limb,—even if he be the offerer’s servant—he should remove from there.
The Brāhmaṇa or the mendicant who comes seeking for food, he shall entertain, to the best of his ability, on being permitted by the Brāhmaṇas.
Having mixed up the food of all kinds and wetted it with water, he should throw it before the Brāhmaṇas who have eaten, scattering it on the ground.
The remnant and that which has been scattered on the Kuśa grass form the share of those who have died without sacraments, and of those who have abandoned family ladies.
At the rite in honour of the Pitṛs, the remnant fallen on the ground is regarded as the share of straightforward, dutiful servants.
For the twice-born person just dead, there should be (performed) the rite up to the ‘Sapiṇḍīkaraṇa’: one should do the feeding at his Śrāddha without any in honour of the gods, and he shall offer one ball.
But after the Amalgamating Rite has been duly performed, the offering of balls shall be done by the sons, by this same method.
He who, having eaten at a śrāddha, gives the leavings to a śūdra,—this foolish man falls headlong into the Kālasūtra hell.
Having eaten at a Śrāddha, if one enters the bed of a woman on that day, his ancestors lie in her ordure for the whole of that month.
Having asked—“Have you dined well?”—he shall, after they have been fully satisfied, make them wash; and when they have washed, he shall say—“You may rest where you choose.
The Brāhmaṇas should thereupon tell him—“May there be svadhā.” at all rites performed in honour of the Pitṛs, the syllable “Svadhā” constitutes the highest benediction.
He shall then inform them of the food that may be left after they have eaten; being permitted by the Brāhmaṇas he shall do as they tell him.
At the rite in honour of the Pitṛs, one should say “svaditam” (well-dined); at the Goṣṭha, “suśṛtam” (well-cooked); at the Ābhyudayika rite, “sampannam” (accomplished); and at the rite in honour of the gods, “rucitam” (agreeable).
The afternoon, Kuśa-Grass, setting up of the dwelling, sesamum grains, liberality, cleaning and superior Brāhmaṇas;—these are the essentials of Śrāddha-rites.
Kuśa-Grass, the sanctificatory texts, the forenoon, all kinds of sacrificial food, purity and also the afore-mentioned these should be regarded as the essentials of a sacrifice.
The food of hermits, milk, the soma-herb, meat that is not forbidden, salt other than alkaline. are, by nature, called “sacrificial food.”
Having dismissed those Brāhmaṇas, he, with collected mind, controlled in speech and pure, turning towards the southern quarter, shall beg these boons of his ancestors.
‘May our benefactors prosper! As also the Vedas and our progeny! May our faith never waver! May there be much for us to give away!’
Having made the offering thus, he should, after this, either make the cow or the Brāhmaṇa or the goat or the fire to eat the balls, or throw them into water.
Some people do the ball-offering afterwards, others cause them to be eaten by birds, or throw them into fire or water.
The lawful wife, devoted to her husband and intent upon the worshipping of the Pitṛs, should, if desirous of a son, eat in the proper manner, the middlemost ball.
She brings forth a long-lived son, endowed with fame and intelligence, wealthy, with numerous offspring, good and righteous.
Having washed the hands and sipped water, he should make offerings to his paternal relations; and having treated his paternal relations well, he should feed his other relations also.
The leavings shall remain until the Brāhmaṇas have been dismissed. After that, he should make the domestic offerings. Such is the established law.
I shall now fully describe what offering-material, on being offered to the Pitṛs, according to role, serves for a long time, and for eternity.
By the proper offering of sesamum, rice and barley, māṣa, water, roots and fruits, men’s ancestors are satisfied for one month.
For two months by fish-meat; for three months by the meat of deer; for four by that of sheep, and for five by that of birds.
For six months by the meat of goat; for seven by that of spotted deer; for eight by that of the black antelope, and for nine by that of the Ruru deer.
They are satisfied for ten months by the meat of boars and buffaloes; and for eleven months by the meat of the hare and the tortoise.’
For one year by cow’s milk and milk-preparations; and by the meat of old goat there is satisfaction lasting for twelve years.
The “Kālaśāka,” the porcupine, the meat of the rhinoceros and the red goat, and honey serve for endless time; as also all kinds ok her mit’s food.
Whatever thing, mixed with honey, one might offer on the thirteenth day of the month, during the rains, under the asterism of Maghā,—that also would be imperishable.
‘May there be one in our family, who may offer milk-rice mixed with honey and butter on the thirteenth, and when the shadow of the elephant falls towards the east.’
Whatever one endowed with faith, offers, according to rule and in the right manner,—that becomes endless and inexhaustible for the Pitṛs in the other world.
‘No dates are so commended for the offering of śrāddha as those of the dark fortnight, beginning with the tenth day, leaving out the fourteenth.
Performing (the śrāddha) on the even dates and under the even asterisms, one obtains all desires; and honouring the Pitṛs on the odd ones, he obtains prosperous offspring.
Just as, for purposes of śrāddha, the latter half of the month is preferable to the former half, so also, the afternoon is preferable to the forenoon.
Until death, one shall perform, with assiduity, the rite in honour of the Pitṛs, according to rule, with the sacred thread passing over the right shoulder, making offerings “from off the left” (to the right) with kuśa-grass in his hand.
One should not perform Śrāddha at night; for the night has been declared to be ‘fit for demons;’—nor at the two twilights, nor when the sun has just risen.
In accordance with this rule, one should offer Śrāddha thrice in the year—during winter, summer and the rain; and that which forms part of the “five sacrifices” should be done every day.
The oblation into fire made in connection with the rite in honour of the Pitṛs has not been prescribed as to be offered into the common fire; and for the Brāhmaṇa who has set up the fire, there is no Śrāddha apart from the Moonless day.
When the best of Brāhmaṇas, having bathed, satisfies the Pitṛs with water,—by that alone he obtains the whole reward of the performance of the offering to the Pitṛs.
They call the Fathers “Vasus;” the grandfathers they call “Rudras,” and the great-grandfathers they call “ādityas” such is the ancient text.
One should daily live upon “vighasa,” and daily he should eat “amṛta.” “Vighasa” is that which is left by those who must be fed; and “amṛta” is the remnant of sacrific es.
Thus has been described to you the procedure of the “Five Sacrifices;” listen now to the means of livelihood for the best of twice-born persons.
Having dwelt, during the first quarter of his life, with the Teacher, the Brāhmaṇa shall, during the second quarter of his life, live in his house, after having taken a wife.
While living in the house, The Brāhmaṇa shall, in normal times, subsist by taking to that means of livelihood which involves no trouble—or very little trouble—to living beings.
For the accomplishment of bare maintenance, one shall accumulate wealth by means of one’s own irreproachable occupations, without causing trouble to the body.
He shall live in “Truth” and “Nectar,” or by “Death” and “Super-death;” or, even by “Truth and Falsehood;” but never by the “living of the dog.”
Gleaning and picking is to be known as “Truth;” and what is obtained unasked, “Nectar”; alms obtained by begging is “Death,” and cultivation is declared to be “Super- death.”
Trade is “Truth and Falsehood;” even by that one may live. Service has been declared, to be the “living of dogs;” hence one should avoid it.
He shall be either one possessing a granary full of grains, or one possessing a jar full of grains; he may be one possessing what is wanted for three days, or one who does not possess enough for the morrow.
Among these four Brāhmaṇa-householders, each later should be regarded as superior, and a superior winner of worlds by virtue of his merit.
From among these one follows the six occupations; another lives by three; one again with two; while the fourth lives by “Brahmasattra.’
‘Living by gleanings and pickings, intent upon the performance of Agnihotra, one should constantly offer only those Iṣṭi-sacrificer that pertain to the moonless and full-moon days and to the solstices.;
He shall never follow the worldly way, for the sake of subsistence; he shall live the straightforward, sincere and pure life of the Brāhmaṇa.
He who wants happiness should adopt perfect contentment and remain self-controlled. Happiness has its root in contentment, and its opposite is the root of unhappiness.
The twice-born Accomplished Student, living by any one of these means of livelihood, should keep these (following) observances, which are conducive to heaven, longevity and fame.
He shall, without sloth, always perform his own duty as prescribed in the Veda. Performing that, to the best of his ability, he attains the highest state.
He shall not seek wealth by clinging pursuits, or by contrary acts; nor when wealth is already there; nor from here and there, even in times of distress.
He shall not, through desires, become addicted to any sensual objects; excessive addiction to these, he shall avoid by mental reflection.
He shall relinquish all things impeding study, maintaining himself somehow. This is what constitutes the accomplish ment of his aims.
He should wander about in this world, keeping his dress, speech and thoughts in conformity with his age, occupation, wealth, learning and family.
He shall always pore over such treatises as quickly enliven the intelligence, are conducive to wealth and are beneficial,—as also over the Vedic Scriptures.
For, as the man goes on studying a science, so does he go on understanding, and then his knowledge shines forth.
To the rest of his power, he shall never omit the sacrifice to the sages, the sacrifice to the gods, the sacrifice to elementals, the sacrifice to men and the sacrifice to the Pitṛs.
Some persons, conversant with the ordinances relating to sacrifices, who do not cherish ant desires, regularly offer these great sacrifices into the sense-organs.
Some people constantly offer their life-breath into speech, and their speech into the life-breath,—knowing that in speech and in life-breath rests the imperishable fulfilment of sacrifices.
Other Brāhmaṇas, looking, with the eye of knowledge, upon this act as having its root in knowledge, always sacrifice with these sacrifices, by means of knowledge.
He shall always offer the Agnihotra, either at the beginning, or, at the end, of day and night, as also the “Darśa” and the “Paurṇamāsa” at the end of each half-month.
At the end of the grains, the Brāhmaṇa shall perform the “New-Harvest sacrifice;” at the end of the seasons, the “Adhvara-sacrifices;” at the end of the solstices the “Animal-sacrifice;” and at the end of the year the “Soma-sacrifices.”
Without having performed the New-Harvest sacrifice, and the animal Sacrifice, the Brāhmaṇa, who has set up the fire, shall not eat new grain or meat,—if he desires to live a long life.
For his Fires, greedy or n ew grains and meat, seek to devour his very life, if they are not worshipped with new grains and with meat.
No guest shall dwell in his house without being honoured, to the best of his ability, with seat, food, bed, or with water, fruits and roots.
He shall not honour, even with speech, impostors, those who follow improper occupations, those who are cat-like in their behaviour, hypocrites, logicians, and those who behave like herons.
Those who have become Snatakas after studying the Veda, or after completing their vows, (and) householders, who are Srotriyas, one must worship by (gifts of food) sacred to gods and manes, but one must avoid those who are different.
The Householder shall give as much as he can to those who do not cook their own food; and, for the sake of all living beings, he shall make apportionment, without detriment (to himself).
Suffering from hunger, the accomplished student should seek for wealth from the king, or from one at whose sacrificial rites he officiates, or from his pupil; and not from others; such is the rule.
The Accomplished Brāhmaṇa shall not, if he can, suffer from hunger; nor shall he wear torn or dirty clothes, so long as he has any property.
Keeping his hair, nails and beard clipped, subdued, wearing white clothes, pure,—he shall always remain engaged in Vedic study, also in what may be conducive to his welfare.
He shall hold a stick of bamboo, and also a water-pot full of water, the sacred thread, a handful of kuśa-grass and a pair of bright golden ear-rings.
He shall not look at the Sun when rising, nor when setting, nor when it is eclipsed, nor when it is in water, nor when it has reached the middle of the sky.
He shall not step over the rope to which a calf is tied; he shall not run when it is raining; he shall not look at his own figure in water; such is the established rule.
By a mound of clay, a cow, a deity, a Brāhmaṇa, clarified butter, honey, a cross-way and the well-known trees—he shall pass in such a manner as to leave them on his right.
Even though mad, he shall not approach a woman during her courses; nor shall he sleep on the same bed with her.
Of the man who approaches a woman covered with impurity,—intelligence, vitality, strength, sight and longevity wear off.
Of that same man, if he avoids the woman covered with impurity, intelligence, vitality, strength, sight and longevity flourish.
He shall not eat with his wife; nor shall he look at her while she is eating, or snoring, or yawning, or sitting at her ease.
The brāhmaṇa, desiring brightness, shall not look at a woman who is a pplying collyrium to her own eyes, or who has anointed herself, or who is uncovered, or is bringing forth a child.
He shall not eat food with only one piece of cloth on him; he shall not bathe naked; he shall not pass urine on the road, nor on ashes, nor on the haunts of cows.
Nor on ploughed land, nor in water, nor on an oven, nor on a mountain, nor in a ruined temple, nor on an ant-hill.
Nor in holes inhabited by living creatures, nor walking, nor standing, nor on reaching the banks of a river, nor on the mountain-top.
One should never pass faeces or urine, while looking at the wind or fire, or a Brāhmaṇa, or the sun, or water, or cows.
He shall pass it after placing a stick, or a clod, or leaves, or grass, or some such thing, restraining his speech, clean, his b ody wrapped and covered.
In the shade, or in darkness, the Brāhmaṇa may—during the day or the night—do it, with his face towards any direction he pleases; as also where there is danger to life, and when there is fear.’
He shall not blow fire with the mouth; nor shall he look at a naked woman. He shall not throw an unclean thing into fire; nor shall he warm his feet at it.
He shall not place fire under himself; nor shall he step over it; he shall not place it under his feet. He shall not do anything dangerous to life.
At junction-time, he shall not eat, nor travel, nor sleep. He shall not scratch the ground; and he shall not remove his own garland.
He shall not throw into water urine, or faeces, or spittings, or anything else contaminated by unclean things, or blood or poisons.
Alone he shall not sleep in a deserted house. He shall not offer advice to his superior. He shall not converse with a woman in her courses. He shall not go to a sacrifice uninvited.
In the abode of fire, in the cow-pen, in the presence of Brāhmaṇas, during the reading of Vedas, at the time of eating, he shall uncover his right hand.
He shall not prevent a heifer while she is drinking, nor shall he point her out to anybody. Having seen the rainbow in the sky, the wise man shall not show it to any person.
He shall not dwell long in an unrighteous village, nor in one abounding in sickness. Alone, he shall not undertake a journey; nor shall he reside for long on a mountain.
He shall not dwell in a country with a Śūdra King; nor in one surrounded by unrighteous persons; nor in one occupied by impostors;. nor in one frequented by men of the lowest castes.
He shall not eat anything from which oil has been extract ed; he shall not commit gluttony; he shall not eat very early in the morning, nor very late in the evening; nor in the evening, if he has eaten in the morning.
He shall not put forth any exertion without a purpose. He shall not drink water with joined hands. He shall not eat articles of food in his lap. He shall never be too curious.
He shall not dance, nor sing, nor play upon musical instruments, nor clap, nor grind his teeth, nor, when satisfied, shall he create enmity.
He shall never wash his feet in a vessel of white brass. He shall not eat out of a broken dish; nor out of one that is felt to be defiled.
He shall not use shoes, on clothes, or sacred thread, or ornament, or garland, or water-pot, which has been used by others.
He shall not travel with untrained beasts of burden; nor with such as are suffering from hunger or disease; nor with those whose horns, eyes or hoofs are injured; nor with those that are disfigured by their tails.
He should always travel with beasts that are trained, fast, equipped with signs, well endowed with colour and figure,—without striking them much with the goad.
The young sun and the smoke from the dead body, should be avoided, as also a broken seat. He shall not cut his nails and hair, nob shall he tear his nails with his teeth.
He shall not crush clods of earth; nor shall he cut grass with hi s nails. He shall not do an aimless act, nor one that is likely to lead to disagreeable results.
A man who crushes clods, cuts grass or bites his nails, quickly goes to perdition; so also the back-biter and the unclean man.
He shall hot carry on a wrangling conversatioh. He shall not wear a garland outside. Riding on the back of cows and oxen is altogether deprecated.
He shall hot enter a walled village or house, except through the gate. At night, he shalt, keep away, at a long distance, from the roots of trees.
He shall never gamble with dice; he shall not himself carry his shoes; he shall not eat, seated on a bed; nor what has been placed in his hand or on the seat.
Any food containing sesamum, he shall not eat after sunset; he shall never sleep naked; nor go anywhere with mouth unwashed after meals.
He shall eat with wet feet; but he shall not sleep with his feet wet. By eating with wet feet, one would attain long life.
He shall never approach a place difficult of access, which is not within range of his vision; he shall not look at urine or excreta; nor shall he cross a river with his arms
One who is desirous of living a long life, shall not step on hair, nor on ashes, bones and potsherds; or on cotton-seed or chaff.
He shall not associate with outcasts, nor with Cāṇḍālas, nor with Pulkasas; nor with the illiterate; nor with the haughty; nor with Antyas; nor with Antyāvasāyins.
He shall not offer advice to a Śūdra, nor the leavings, nor what has been prepared as an offering to the Gods. He shall hot expound the law to him; nor shall he indicate to him any penance.
He who expounds to him the law, and he who indicates the penance to him, will sink, along with him, into the hell called “asaṃvṛta.”
He shall not scratch his own head with both hands joined together; he shall not touch it while unclean; and he shall not bathe without it.
Catching of the hair, as also striking on the head,—these he shall avoid; having his head bathed, he shall touch no limb with oil.
He shall not accept gifts from a king not born of the Kṣatriya caste; nor from the keepers of slaughterhouses, oil-presses or grog-shops; nor from those who live on brothels.
One oil-press is equal to ten slaughter-houses; one grog-shop is equal to ten oil-presses; one brothel is equal to ten grog-shops; and one king is equal to ten brothels.
A king has been declared to be equal to a butcher who maintains ten thousand slaughter-houses; and terrible is the receiving of gifts from him.
He who accepts gifts from a king who is avaricious and behaves contrary to the scriptures, goes, in succession, to these twenty-one hells:
Tāmisra, Andhatāmisra, Mahāraurava, Raurava, Kālasūtra-Naraka, Mahānaraka, Sañjīvana, Mahāvīci, Tāpana, Sampatāpana, Saṃhāta, Sakākola, Kuḍmala, Pūtimṛttika, Lohaśaṅku, Ṛjīṣa, Pathin, Śālmalī, Nadī, Asipatravana and Lohadāraka.
Knowing this, the learned Brāhmaṇas reading the Vedas do not accept gifts from a king, if they desire to secure welfare after death.
He shall wake up at the point of time sacred to Brahman, and then think over the means of acquiring Merit and wealth, of the bodily troubles involved therein, and also of the true meaning of the Veda.
Having risen, and saving accomplished the necessities of nature, he shall perform the purifications, and, with collected mind, he shall stand, repeating for a long time (the Sāvitrī), during the morning-twilight, as also during the evening-twilight, at its proper time.’
Having perfomed the “Upākarma” (starting rite) on the full- moon day in the month of Śrāvaṇa or of Bhādrapada, the Brāhmaṇa shall, with due diligence, study the vedas, according to rule, during four months and a half.
The Brāhmaṇa shall perform, outside, the “Utsarjana” (Suspension) of the Vedas on the day of the Puṣya asterism, or on the forenoon of the first day of the bright fortnight of the month of Māgha.
Having performed, according to law, the “Utsarga” of the Vedas, he shall cease for the night with its two wings, including the same day and night.
After this, he shall diligently read the Vedas during the bright fortnights, and all the subsidiary sciences during the dark fortnights.
He shall recite, not indistinctly, nor in the proximity of Śūdras; nor shall he go to sleep again, at the end of night, when he is tired after having recited the Veda.
According to the prescribed rule, the Brāhmaṇa shall, every day, during normal times, diligently recite the Veda in verse, as also the Veda in verse and prose.
One who is studying the Veda should always avoid these days, as unfit for study; so also the person who is doing the teaching of pupils according to rule.
(a) At night, when air is audible by the ear, and (b) in the day when there is dust-whorl,—these two occasions during the rains are declared by those versed in the rules of teaching to be unfit for study.
When there is lightning, thunder and rain,—when there is promiscuous falling of meteors;—on these occasions, there shall be no study till the same time (next day):—thus has Manu declared.
When these appear after the Fires have been lighted, then is it to be regarded as time unfit for study; as also when clouds are seen out of season.
When there is preter-natural sound, when there is earthquake, and when there is an impact of planets,—these are to be regarded as time unfit for study, until the same hour next day,—even during the season.
When lightning and the roar of thunder appear after the Fires have been lighted, the time shall continue to be unfit for study, till the lights are there; and when the remaining (phenomenon) ocours, it is unfit for study during the night, as also during the day.
In villages and cities, it is always unfit for study, for those who seek for perfect merit; as also in foul-shelling places.
In a village where a corpse still lies, in the presence of low people, during weeping, and in a crowd of hen,—it is unfit for study.
In water, at midnight, during the evacuation of the bladder and the bowels, while one is unclean, when one has eaten at a śrāddha, one shall not even think in his mind (of the Veda).
After having accepted invitation to a unitary funeral rite, the learned Brāhmaṇa shall not recite the Veda for three days; as also during the impurity of the king and also of Rāhu.
While the odour and stain of a funeral rite not offered to his own ancestor remain upon the body of a learned Brāhmaṇa, he shall not recite the Veda.
While lying down, while his feet are prominently thrust forward, and while he is seated with his knees tied together, he shall not study; as also after having eaten meat or food given by a person during impurity.
Nor during a fog, nor during the sound of arrows, nor at the two twilights, nor on the Moonless Day, nor on the fourteenth day, nor on the Full Moon Day, nor on the eighth day.
The Moonless Day destroys the Teacher, the Fourteenth Day destroys the pupil, and the Eighth Day and the Full-moon days destroy the Veda; hence these he shall avoid.
The Brāhmaṇa shall not read during a dust-storm, or while the sky is burning, or while jackals are howling, or while dogs ur donkeys or camels are crying in a line.
He shall not study near the cremation-ground, nor near the village, nor in the cow-pasture, nor while dressed in the garment worn during sexual intercourse, nor after receiving presents in connection with funeral rites.
Any śrāddha-gift, be it animate or inanimate, if the Brāhmaṇa accepts, it becomes an occasion unfit for study; because the Brāhmaṇa has been declared as having the hand for his mouth.
When the village has bees beset with thieves, when alarm has been caused by fire, it is unfit for study, till the same time next day; as also at the appearance of all portents.
At the ceremony of upākarma and at that of utsarjana, omission of study has been prescribed for three days, but at the Aṣṭakāṣ for one day and night; as also on the last nights of the seasons.
He shall not recite the Veda while seated on a horse, or a tree, or an elephant, or a boat, or a donkey, or a camel; nor when seated on barren ground, nor when going on a conveyance.
Non during an al tercation, ok during a fight; nor in the midst of an army, nor during a battle, nor when he has just eaten, nor during indigestion, nor after vomiting, nor when there is eructation.
Not without having obtained the permission of his guest, nor while the wind blows vehemently; nor when blood has flowed from his body, or his body has been wounded by a weapon.
He shall never recite the Ṛk or the Yajuṣ during a Sāma-chant; nor after having read the end of the Veda, or after having read the Āraṇyaka.
The Ṛgveda is sacred to the gods and the Yajurveda is human; the Sāmaveda has been declared to be related to the Pitṛs; hence its sound is impure.
Knowing this, the learned dally recite first the essence of the three Vedas, in due order; and it is only after this that they recite the Veda.
When cattle, a frog, a cat, a dog, a snake, a mongoose or a rat come between,—one should regard the day and night as unfit for study.
The twice-born man shall always carefully avoid only two conditions as unfit for study: viz. an unclean place of study and his own unclean condition.
On the Moonless Day, on the eighth, on the Full Moon Day, and on the Fourteenth, the twice-born Accomplished Student shall always remain a “Religious Student,” even during the “season.”
He shall not bathe after a meal, nor when he is ill, nor at midnight, nor along with his garments; and never in an unknown water-reservoir.
He shall not intentionally step over the shadow of the gods, of a superior, of the king, of an Accomplished Student, of his own Preceptor, of the tawny thing, or of the Initiated Person.
He shall not have recourse to a cross-road at midday, or at midnight, or after having partaken of meat-food at a śrāddha, or at the two twilights.
He shall not intentionally stand upon unguent-powder, or upon used water, or on urine or ordure, or on blood, or on mucus, spittings and vomitings.
He shall not pay attention to his enemy, or to his enemy’s friend, or to an unrighteous person, or to a thief, or to the lady of another person.
In this world, there is nothing so detrimental to a man’s longevity as paying attention to the wife of another person.
Desiring his own prosperity, he shall never despise a Kṣatriya, a serpent, a learned Brāhmaṇa,—even if they be feeble.
Because these three, when despised, may destroy the man,—therefore, the intelligent man shall never despise these three.
He shall not despise himself by reason of former failures. Until death, he should seek fortune, and he should never think her unattainable.
He shall say what is true; and he shall say what is agreeable; he shall not say what is true, but disagreeale; nor shall he say what is agreeable, but untrue; this is the eternal law.
What is (not) well, he shall call “well”; or, he shall simply say “well;” he shall not create needless enmity or dispute with any one.
He shall not go about either too early in the morning or too late in the evening, or just at midday; nor with an unknown person, nor alone, nor with Śūdras.
He shall not insult those who have redundant limbs, or those who are deficient in limbs, or those destitute of learning, or those who are far advanced in age, or those destitute of beauty or wealth, or those of low birth.
A Brāhmaṇa, while unclean, shall hot touch, with his hand, a cow, a Brāhmaṇa or fire. Nor shall he, being in good health, look at the luminaries in the sky, while he is impure.
Having touched these, while impure, he shall always wipe with water, with his palm, his sense-organs, as also his limbs and the navel.
Unless he be in trouble, he shall not, without cause, touch his cavities. He shall also avoid all secret hairs.
He shall be intent upon auspicious customs, with his mind under control and the senses subjugated; and he shall, untired, daily recite prayers and offer oblations into the fire.
For those who are ever intent upon auspicious customs, who have their mind under control, and who go on reciting prayers and offering oblations,—there is no calamity.
He shall diligently recite the Veda, whenever he finds time. They declare this to be his primary duty; everything else is declared to be his secondary duty.
By the constant recitation of the Veda, by purification, by austerity, and by doing no harm to living beings, he remembers his previous birth.
Recollecting his former births, the twice-born person continues to study the Veda; and by his continuous study of the Veda, he obtains absolute, endless bliss.
On special days, he shall always offer the oblations to Savitṛ, and also the Pacificatory Oblations; on the “Aṣtakas” and on the “Anvaṣṭakas” he shall always worship the Pitṛs.’
Far from the dwelling-place shall he perform urination, far off he shall perform feet-washing, and far away he shall do the throwing of the leavings of food.
In the forenoon, he shall perform the evacuation of bow els, toilette, bath, cleaning of the teeth, dying of the eyes, and the worship of the gods.
On the Parvas he should go to the gods, and to the righteous Brāhmaṇas, to the King for protection, and also to the superiors.
By Right Conduct he attains longevity; by Right Conduct he obtains desirable children; by Right Conduct he obtains inexhaustible wealth; and Right Conduct destroys everything inauspicious.
The man of evil conduct becomes deprecated among men; he is constantly suffering pain, is sick and short-lived.
He shall carefully avoid every such act as is dependent upon others; such acts as are dependent upon himself, every one of these he shall eagerly pursue.
All that is dependent on others is painful; all that is dependent on oneself is pleasing; he shall know this to be, in short, the definition of pleasure and pain.
He shall perform, with diligence that act, by performing which there arises satisfaction in his inner soul; and he shall avoid the contrary.
He shall not injure his Preceptor, or Teacher or Father, or mother, or another elder, or Brāhmaṇas, or Cows, or any persons performing austerities.
He shall, avoid atheism, cavilling at the Vedas, abusing of the gods, hatred, haughtiness, pride, anger and hastiness.
He shall not, when angry, raise the rod against another person, nor shall he let it fall; except in the case of the son or the pupil; these two he may beat with a view to correction.
The twice-born person who threatens a Brāhmaṇa, with the intention of striking him, wanders about in the tāmisra hell for a hundred years.
Having, in anger, struck him intentionally, even with a straw, he is born, during twenty-one births, in sinful wombs.
The man, who, through folly, causes blood to flow from the body or a Brāhmaṇa who is not fighting, undergoes, after death, very great suffrring.
As many particles of dust the blood takes up from the ground, during so many years is the blood-spiller devoured by others in the other world.
For these reasons, the learned man shall never even threaten a twice-born person; he shall not strike him even with a straw; and he shall not spill blood from his body.
The man who is unrighteous, he whose wealth is mis-begotten, and he who is always addicted to injuring, never obtains happiness in this world.
Perceiving the quick overthrow of unrighteous sinners, he shall not turn his mind towards unrighteousness, even though suffering in consequence of righteonsness.
Unrighteousness, practised in this world, does not, like the Earth (or the Cow) bring its fruit immediately; but, accumulating gradually, it outs off the roots of the perpetrator.
If not on himself, then on his sons,—if not on his sons, then on his grandsons (falls the punishment); an unrighteousness, once committed, never fails to bring its consequences to the perpetrator.
For a time one prospers through unrighteousness, for a while he experiences good things, and for a time he conquers his enemies; but, after all, he perishes root and branch.
He shall always delight in truthfulness, Law and right conduct, as also in ceanliness (cleanliness?); he shall govern his pupils in accordance with law,—with his speech arms, and belly duly controlled.
He shall, avoid such wealth and pleasures as are opposed to righteousness, as also righteousness if it be conducive to unhappiness, or disapproved by the people.
He shall not be fickle with his hands and feet, nor fickle with his eyes, nor crooked, nor fickle with his speech, nor harm others by deed or thought.
He shall tread the path of the righteous by the same way in which his fathers and grandfathers have trodden; going by that way, he shall not suffer.
He shall not have a quarrel with the officiating priest, the priest, or his Teacher, or with his maternal uncle, or his guests or dependants, with children, or with old or sick persons, or with doctors, with his paternal relations or marriage relations, with his parents, or female relations, or brother or son, or wife, or daughter, or with his slaves.—(179-180).
Having renounced quarrel with these, the householder becomes freed from all sins; and, by ignoring them, he wins all these worlds.
The teacher is the lord of the world of Brahmā; the Father is sovereign of the world of Prajāpati; the Guest is the master of the world of Indra; and the Priests are the lords of the world of gods.
Female relatives (have power) over the region of the Heavenly nymphs; maternal relations, over that of the Viśvedevas; marriage-relations, over the region of the Waters; the mother and maternal uncle, over the Earth; the children, the aged, the emaciated and the sick should be regarded as the lords of Ākāśa; the elder brother is equal to the Father; the wife and the son are one’s own body.—(183-184).
Slaves are one’s own shadow; the daughter is the highest object of tenderness. For these reasons, when offended by these, he shall always bear it without heat.
Though entitled to accept presents, he shall avoid addiction to it; because, by receiving gifts, his spiritual light is quickly extinguished.
Withuot knowing the lawful method of receiving gifts, the wise man shall not accept any gifts; even though he may be pining with hunger.
The illiterate person, accepting gold, land, horse, cow food, clothing, sesamum and clarified butter, becomes reduced to ashes, like wood.
Gold and food destroy longevity; land and cow destroy the body; the horse destroys the eye; clothing destroys the skin; clarified butter destroys energy; and sesamum destroys offspring.
If the twice-born person,who is without austerities and does not study the Veda, seeks for gifts, he sinks along with him into water; just like one who sinks along with the stone-raft.
For these reasons, the illiterate man should fight shy of accepting each and every gift. By receiving even a small gift, the illiterate person sinks, like the cow in a morass.
The man knowing the Law, shall not offer even water to the Brāhmaṇa who behaves like a cat; nor to the wicked Brāhmaṇa who behaves like a heron, nor to one ignorant of the Veda.
For property, even though acquired by lawful means,—if given to these three persons,—brings calamity, in the next world, to the giver, as also to the receiver.
Just as a man crossing water by means of a stone-raft sinks down, so also sink downwards the ignorant giver and receiver.
He who displays his flag of virtue, is ever covetous, a cheat and a hypocrite, intent on doing harm, and the traducer of all persons, is to be known as “one behaving like the cat.”
With eyes cast downwards, of cruel disposition, intent upon the accomplishment of his own ends, dishonest and falsely humble;—such is the Brāhmaṇa ‘who behaves like the heron’.
Those Brāhmaṇas who are heron-like in their behaviour, and those who are cat-like, fall, by that sinful act, into the Andhatāmisra hell.
Having committed a sin, he shall not perform penance un der the pretext of doing a righteous act,—deceiving women and Śūdras by thus covering his sin by a penance.
Such Brāhmaṇas are condemned after death, and also here (in this life) by the expounders of the Veda; and penance done under a false pretence goes to the evil spirits.
One who, though not entitled to the wearing of a certain badge, gains one’s living by wearing that badge, takes off the sins of persons entitled to that badge, and is born in the womb of a lower animal.
He shall never bathe in the tanks belonging to other persons. Having bathed there, he becomes tainted with a part of the tank-digger’s sin.
By using another person’s conveyance, couch, seat, well, garden or house,—when these have not been given,—one becomes the partaker of the fourth part of that person’s sins.
He shall always bathe in rivers and in tanks and lakes dug by the gods; as also in water-holes and springs.
The wise man shall always observe the Restraints, but not necessarily the Observances. Not observing the Restraints, and keeping the Observances alone, he falls.
The Brāhmaṇa shall never eat at a sacrifice performed by one who has not learnt the Veda; or at one performed by a village-priest, or at one offered by a woman or a eunuch.
Where such persons pour the oblations, it is considered indecent by all good men; it is disagreeable to the gods; hence, one should avoid it
He shalll never eat food offered by intoxicated or angry or sick persons; nor that which is contaminated by hair or insects, or that which has been intentionally touched with the foot.
Nor that which has been looked at by the Brāhmaṇa-slayer, or what has been toughed by a woman in her courses, or what has been pecked by the birds, or what has been touched by a dog.
Nor the food that has been smelt by the cow, nor particularly that food which has been publicly offered, nor the food that belongs to a multitude, nor the food of the harlot, nor that which has been censured by the learned.
Nor the food of the thief or the singer, nor of the carpenter, the usurer, of the initiated person, of the miser, the prisoner and the fettered.
Nor the food of an accused person, or of the hermaphrodite, or the unchaste woman, or the hypocrite; nor the food turned sour, or that kept overnight, or what forms the leavings of the Śūdra.
Nor the food of this physician, or of the hunter, or of a cruel person, or of one who lives on leavings; nor the food of the “Ugra;” nor what has been cooked for the newly-delivered woman, until ten days have passed; nor that which has been interrupted by washing.
Nor what is offered without respect, nor improper meat, nor food belonging to a male-less female, nor the food of an eneny, nor the food of the city-lord, nor the food of an outcast, nor that which has been sneezed at.
Nor the food of the informer and the perjurer, or of the seller of sacrifices; nor the food of the actor or the tailor; nor the food of the ungrateful person.
‘Nor or the blacksmith, of the Niṣāda, of the stage-player, of the goldsmith, of the plater of musical instruments, or of the dealer in weapons,’
Nor of dog-keepers, or of wine-sellers or of the clothes-washer, or of the dyer, or of the bard, or of the man in whose house there is a paramour.
Nor of thos e who bear the presence of the paramour, or of those who are entirely ruled b y women; nor the food of those in whose house death has occurred and the ten days have not passed; nor that which is disagree able.
The king’s food takes off one’s vigour and the Śūdra’s food his Brahmic glory; the goldsmith’s food his longevity, and the l eather-cutter’s food hi s fame.
The food of artisans impairs the offspring, that of the clothes-washer impairs strength; the food of a multitude and the food of the harlot out off the max from the regions.
The food of the physician is pus; the food of the unchaste woman is semen; the food of the usurer is ordure, and that of the dealer in weapons is dirt.—(220.)
The food of those other persons who have been successively mentioned as those whose food should not be eaten,—the wise men describe as skin, bones and hairs.
After unknowingly eating the food of any one of these, there should be a three days’ fast. Having eaten it knowingly, as also on eating semen, ordure and urine, one should perform the “Kṛcchra” penance.
The learned Brāhmaṇa shall, not eat the cooked food of the Śūdra who performs no śrāddhas. In the absence of livelihood, he may receive from him raw grain sufficient for one day.
The gods having compared the food of the miserly Vedic Scholar and that of the liberal usurer, ordained the food of both to be equal.
Thereupon Prajāpati came to them and said—“Do not make the unequal equal: what belongs to the liberal man is purified by faith, while the other is defiled by want of faith.
He shall always diliqenty perform, with faith, sacrifices and other religious acts; done with faith, and with well-begotten wealth, they become imperishable.
He shall practise, to the best of his ability, charity and righteousness in connection with sacrifices and acts of piety with a cheerful heart, if he finds a suitable recipient.
When asked, he should give something, without showing any displeasure. Because he may turn out to be a worthy recipient who will save him from everything.
The giver of water obtains satisfaction, the giver of food imperishable happiness, the giver of sesamum desirable offspring, and this giver of lamp most excellent eyesight.
The giver of land obtains land, the giver of gold long life, the giver of house excellent mansions, and the giver of silver exquisite beauty.
The giver of cloth obtains resemblance to the Moon, the giver of horse resemblance to horse-owners, the giver of the ox great good fortune, and the giver of the cow toe region of the Sun.
The giver or carriage and couch obtains a wife, the giver of fearlessness sovereignty, the giver of grains eternal happiness, and the giver of the Veda equality with Brahman.
The giving or Veda surpasses all gifts or water, food, cows, buffaloes, clothes, sesamum, gold and clarified butter.
In whatever spirit a man bestows a gift, in that same spirit he himself receives it with due honour.
He who receives respectfully, as well as he who gives respectfully,—both these go to heaven; but to hell, in the contrary case.
He shall not be proud of his austerities; having offered a sacrifice, he shall not utter a lie; even when tormented, he shall not revile the brāhmaṇas; having bestowed a gift, he shall not advertise it.
The sacrifice trickles away by falsehood, the austerity trickles away by vanity, longevity by the reviling of Brāhmaṇas, and gifts by advertisement.
Without causing pain to any beings, he shall, for the purpose of obtaining a companion in the other world, accumulate spiritual merit, slowly; just as the white ants accumulate the ant-hill.
There, neither father, nor mother, nor wife, nor sons, nor relations stay as companions; spiritual merit alone remains.
Alone is a creature born, and alone does it cease to be; alone it enjoys its good deeds and also its evil deeds.
Leaving the dead body on the ground, like a log of wood or a clod of earth, the relations depart with averted faces; spiritual merit alone follows him.
He shall, therefore, slowly accumulate Spiritual Merit, for the purpose of securing a companion; for, with Merit as his companion, the man crosses over unfordable darkness.
It speedily carries the man, who is devoted to duty and has his sins destroyed by austerities, clothed in his own (spiritual) body, to the brighter regions above.
Being desirous of raising his family to eminence, he shall always form connections with superior kinds of people; he shalt, avoid all inferior ones.
Having recourse to superior kinds of people, and avoiding the inferior kinds, the Brāhmaṇa attains eminence; by the contrary procedure, he becomes a Śūdra.
He who acts resolutely, is gentle and tolerant, who does not associate with persons of cruel disposition, and who does no injury to others, shall win heaven by his self-control and liberality, if he sticks to this practice.
He may accept from all persons fuel, water, roots, and fruits, and food that is offered, as also honey and the gift of fearlessness.’
Alms brougt forward and offered, and not previously begged, Prajāpati has declared to be acceptable, even from a sinful person.
Of the man that disdains it, the Pitṛs do no eat any food for ten and five years; nor does fire convey his offering to the gods.
He shall not refuse a couch, a house, kuśa grass, perfumes, water, flowers, jewels, curd, grain, fish, milk, meat and vegetables.
For the purpose of bringing relief to his teachers and dependents, and for the purpose of honoring the gods and guests, he may accept gifts from all persons; but he shall not derive from them satisfaction for himself.
When, however, the Teachers are dead, or when one lives in his house without them,—then, seeking for his own subsistence, he may always accept gifts from good persons.
His own ploughman, hereditary friend, cowherd, slave and barder,—among Śūdras; these are persons whose food may be eaten; as also one who offers himself.
As the man’s character may be, as may be the nature of the work he wishes to do, and as may be the manner in which he may serve,—even so must he offer himself.
He, who describes himself to good men otherwise than what he is, is the worst sinner in the world, a thief stealing himself.
All things are regulated by speech, have their root in speech, and emanate from speech. The man who steals such speech is the stealer of all things.
Having paid off, according to law, the debts owing to the Great Sages, to the Pitṛs and to the Gods, he shall consign everything to his son and remain fixed in neutrality.
Alone, in solitude, he shall meditate upon what is good for himself. By meditating in solitude, he attains the highest good.
Thus has been described the eternal course of life of the Brāhmaṇa-Householder, as also the series of observances for the Accomplished Student, which is conducive to the increase of the quality of goodness, and is praiseworthy.
The Brāhmaṇa, learned in the Vedic soriptures, who conducts himself by this course of life, has his sins removed, and remains for ever exalted in the region of Brahman.
The sages, having heard the duties of the Accomplished Student as just described, said this to the high-souled Bhṛgu, who sprang from fire.
“How is it, O Lord, that Death overpowers the Brāhmaṇas who are learned in the Vedic lore, and who perform their duty exactly as it has been thus described?”
Bhṛgu, the righteous son of Manu, said to the great sages—“Listen, by what fault Death seeks to destroy the Brāhmaṇas.”
Garlic, leeks and onions, mushrooms and all that proceeds from impure things, are unfit to re eaten by twice-born men.
He shall carefully avoid the red exudation from trees, as also those flowing from incisions, the śelu berries, and ‘curdled milk’ of the cow.
Needlessly cooked Rice-sesamum and Butter-sugar-sesamum, milk-rice and flour-cakes, unconsecrated meat, food of the gods and sacrificial viands;
The milk of the cow that has not passed its ten days, as also that of the camel and of one-hoofed animals and of sheep; the milk of the irregular cow, as also the milk of the cow without her calf.
That of all wild animals, except the buffalo; the milk of females (women) and all soured substances should be avoided.
Among Soured Substances, the curd is fit to be eaten, and all that is prepared out of it; as also all that is distilled from pure flowers, roots and fruits;
He shall avoid all carnivorous birds, and also those living in villages, the one-hoofed animals not specified, and also the Ṭiṭṭibha.
The Sparrow, the Plava, the Haṃsa, the Cakravāka; the village-cock, the Crane, the Rajjudāla, the Dātyūha, the Parrot and the Starling.
Those birds that feed by striking with their beaks, those that are web-footed, the koyaṣṭi, those that scratch with their nails, those that dive and eat fish, slaughter-house meat, and dried meat.
The Baka, the Balākā, the Kākola, the Khañjarīṭa, the fish-eaters, and village pigs; as also fish always.
He who eats the flesh of an animal, is called the ‘eater of its flesh’; he who eats fish is the ‘eater of all kinds of flesh’; hence one shall avoid fish.
The ‘Pāṭhīna’ and the ‘Rohita’ are fit to be eaten when used as offerings to gods or Pitṛs; the ‘Rājīva’, the ‘Siṃhatuṇḍa’ and the ‘Saśalka,’ (one may eaṭ) on all occasions
He shall not eat solitary animals, nor unknown beasts and birds, even though indicated among those fit to be eaten; nor any five-nailed animals.
Among five-nailed animals they declare the porcupine, the hedge-hog, the alligator, the rhinoceros, the tortoise and the hare, as fit to be eaten; as also all animals having one line of teeth. except the camel.
The mushroom, the village-pig, garlic, the village-cock, onions and leeks,—the twice-born man eating these intentionally would become an ou tcast.
Having eaten these unintentionally, he should perform the ‘Kṛcchra Sāntapana’, or the ‘Yati-Cāndrāyaṇa’; and in the case of the rest one should fast for a day.
Once a year the Brāhmaṇa shall perform the ‘Kṛcchra’ penance, in order to atone for unintentional eating; but for intentional eating, special ones.
The commended beasts and birds may be killed by Brāhmaṇas for the purpose of sacrifice, and for the purpose of feeding their dependents; as Agastya did this of old.
In ancient times, at sacrifices performed by the sages, as also at sacrifices performed by Brāhmaṇas and Kṣatriyas, the sacrificial cakes were made of eatable beasts and birds.
Such Food and eatables as are mixed with oils may be eaten though stale, if unspoilt; so also what may be the remnant of a sacrificial offering.
All that is made of barley and wheat, as also all preparations of milk, may be eaten by twice-born men, without being mixed with oils, even though they may have been kept long
Thus has been described is full what is fit and what unfit to be eaten by twice-born men. Next I am going to explain the rule regarding the eating and avoiding of meat.
He may eat meat that has been consecrated; also at the wish of Brāhmaṇas; and when invited according to law; and when his life is in danger.
Prajāpati created all this as food for the vital spirit; and all that is movable or immovable is the food of the vital spirit
The immobile is the food of the mobile; those devoid of fangs are the food of those endowed with fangs; those without hands are the food of those with hands; and cowards are the food of the brave.
The eater incurs no sin by eating, even daily, such animals as are eatable: since the eater as well as the eaten animals have been created by the creator himself
The sin of the man who kills animals for gain is not so great, after death, as that of the man who eats needlessly-prepared meat.
But when invited according to law, if a man does not e at meat, he becomes, after death, a beast, during twenty- one births.
The Brāhmaṇa shall never eat animals that have not been consecrated with sacred texts; but those that have been consecrated with sacred texts, he shall eat, taking, his stand upon the eternal law.
If there is occasion, he shall make an animal of clarified butter, or an animal of flour; but he shall never seek to kill an animal needlessly.
As many hairs there are on the body of the animal, so m any times after dying does its needless killer suffer violent death, birth after birth.—(38.)
Animals have been created by the Self-born God himself for the purpose of sacrifice: sacrifice is conducive to the well-being of all this would; hence killing at a sacrifice is no ‘killing’ at all
Herbs, animals, trees, beasts and birds, reaching death for the sake of sacrifices, attain advancements.
At the Madhuparka offering, at sacrifices, and at the rites in honour of the Pitṛs,—at these alone should animals be killed, and nowhere else: thus has Manu declared
If a man performs the Aśvamedha Sacrifice every year, for a hundred tears,—and another does not eat meat,—the merit and reward of both these are the same.—(53.)
By subsisting upon sacred fruits and roots, and by eating the food of hermits, one does not obtain that reward which he does by abstaining from meat
‘Me he (māṃ-sa) will devour in the next world, whose meat I eat in this’—this is the ‘meatness’ (māṃsatva) of the ‘meat’ (māṃsa), as the wise ones declare.
There is no sin in the eating of meat, nor in wine, nor in sexual intercourse. Such is the natural way of living beings; but abstention is conducive to great rewards.
I am going to describe, in due order, purification on death, as also purification of substances, as prescribed for all the four castes.
When a child dies that has teethed, or one younger than it when its tonsure has been performed, all its relatives are ‘impure’. The same is declared to be the case with births also.
Among ‘Sapiṇḍas’. the period of impurity due to death is ordained to last for ten days; or till the collecting of the bones, or for three days, or for one day only
The ‘Sapiṇḍa-relationship’ ceases with the person in the seventh-degree and the ‘Samānodaka-relationship,’ when the origin and the name become unrecognisable
Thus also should it be at a birth; but the parturient disability attaches to the parents only; or, the parturient disability would attach to the mother alone, and the father would become purified by bathing.
The man, having emitted semen becomes pure by bathing; hence, on account of seminal filiation he should observe impurity for these days.
Those who touch this corpse become pure after one day and one day along with three three-day periods; those who offer water, after three days.
The pupil performing the ‘Pitṛmedha’ for his dead Teacher becomes purified in ten days; just as those who carry the dead body.
In the case of miscarriage, the woman becomes pure in so mamy days as there have been months; and the woman in her courses becomes fit by bathing after the ceasing of the menstrual flow.
In the case of persons whose tonsure has not been performed purification has been declared to come after a night; but in the case of those whose tonsure has been performed, purification is held to come after three days.
The child that dies while less than two years old, the relations should, after having decked it, place outside, under the ground that is clean and not defiled by heaps of bones.
For this child no sanctification by fire shall be performed; nor shall water-offering he made to it; having left it like a log of wood, in the forest, one shall keep aloof for three days.
For the child up to three years of age, the relations shall not make water-offerings; but for one whose teeth had appeared, or whose naming had been done, it may be done optionally.
On the death of a fellow-student, the impurity has been declared to last for one day. In the case of a birth, the purity of the ‘Samānopaka’ relations is held to come after three pays.
In the case of women whose sacramentary rite has not been performed, the marital relations become pure after three days; and their paternal relations also become pure according to the rule prescribed before
For three days they should eat food free from salines and salts, should bathe, should not eat meat-food and should sleep apart on the ground.
This rule regarding Impurity due to death has been described in reference to cases where the parties are near one another. In reference to cases where they are not near, Kinsmen and relations should observe the following rule.
He who hears, within ten days, of a relation resident in a foreign land having died, shall, remain impure for the remainder of the period of ten days.
If the period of ten days has elapsed, he shall remain impure for three days; but when a year has elapsed, he becomes pure by merely touching water.
Hearing of the death of a kinsman, or of the birth of a son, after the ten days have elapsed, the man becomes pure by plunging into water with his clothes
In the event of a child, resident in a foreign country, who is a non-sapiṇḍa relation, dying,—one becomes pure immediately, by plunging into water wth his clothes on.
If, within ten days, another birth or death happen to befall, the Brāhmaṇa shall remain impure until that period of ten days shall have elapsed.
On the death of the Teacher, they declare the impurity to last for three days; on the death of his son or wife, it lasts for one day and night; such is the law.
In the case of a learned companion, one shall remain impure for three days; in the case of a maternal uncle, a pupil, an officiating priest and relation, for a night along with the two days (preceding and following it).
On the death of the King in whose realm he lives, it lasts till the light; in the case of a non-learned teacher, for the whole day; as also in the case of the (ordinary) teacher.
The Brāhmaṇa becomes pure in the days, the Kṣatriya in twelve days, the Vaiśya in fifteen days and the Śūdra in a month.
One should not prolong the days of impurity; nor should he interrupt the rites performed in the fires; because he who performs those rites, even if he be a Sapiṇḍa, would never he impure.
After having touched the Cāndāla, the menstruating woman, the outcast, the woman in child-bed, the dead body, or toucher thereof—one becomes pure by bathing.
On seeing unclean things, the man, after having sipped water, shall always attentively recite the Solar Mantras according to his inclination, as also the Pāvamānī verses, according to his capacity.
Having touched a fatty human bone, the Brāhmaṇa becomes pure by bathing, but if it be free from fat, then by sipping water and touching a cow, or looking at the sun
The person under instruction shall not make water-offerings till the completion of his pupilage; at its completion, he becomes pure in three days, after having made the water-offerings.
The water-offering is withdrawn from those born in vain and from intermixture, from those who are addicted to asceticism and from those who have abandoned themselves.
Also from women, who have joined a heretic, who behave too freely, who have injured a child in their womb or their husband, and those who drink wine
The student, carrying his own dead Teacher, or tutor, or father, or mother, or monitor,—does not suffer in his observances.
One should carry the dead śūdra by the southern gate of the city; but the twice-born persons by the western, northern and eastern gates respectively
This taint of uncleanliness does not attach to Kings, or to those keeping a vow, or to the performers of sacrificial sessions; because they occupy the position of sovereigns and are ever of the nature of Brahman.
Immediate purification has been ordained for the king on the majestic throne; and the reason for this lies in his occupying that position for the protection of the people.
Also in the case of those killed in a riot or Battle or by lightning or by the king; and of those who have died for the sake of cows and Brāhmaṇas; as also for the person for whom the king desires it.
The King holds in himself the body of the eight guardian deities of the world, of the Moon, the Fire, the Sun, the Wind, Indra, the Lord of Wealth, the Lord of Water, and of Yama.
The King is possessed by the Lords of the World; no im purity, therefore, has been ordained for him; for the purity and impurity affect mortals and have their origin and end in the worldly regions.
For one who is killed in battle with brandished weapons, in the manner befitting the kṣatriya, sacrificial performances become instantly completed; and so also is the impurity; such is the established law
The Brāhmaṇa becomes purified by touching water; the Kṣatriya by touching his conveyance and weapons; the vaiśya by touching either the goad or the leading-strings; and the Śūdra by touching the stick,—after he has performed the rite
O Best or Brāhmaṇas, thus has been described to you the purification necesssary in the case of ‘Sapiṇḍa-relations.’
A Brāhmaṇa, having carried, like a relation, a dead Brāhmaṇa who is not his ‘Sapiṇḍa’ relation,—or the near relatives of his mother,—becomes pure in three days.
But if he eats their food, he becomes pure in ten days; if however he does not eat their food, he is purified in one day, if he does not dwell in that house.
Having voluntarily followed a dead person, whether he be a relation or not, he becomes pure by bathing with his clothes on, touching fire and eating clarified butter.
One should not have a dead Brāhmaṇa carried by a Śūdra, while his own people are there. For it would be an oblation into fire, defiled by the touch of the Śūdra, and as such not conducive to heaven.—(l 03).
Wisdom, austerity, fire, food, clay, mind, water, smearing, wind, action, the sun and time are means of purification for corporeal beings.
Among all modes of purification, purity in regard to wealth has been ordained to be the most important; for he who is pure in regard to wealth is really pure, and he is not pure who is merely purified by clay and water.
Learned men become pure by tolerance; by liberality those who have done what should not be done; secret sinners by the repeating of sacred texts; and by austerity those who are well-versed in the Veda.
What needs purification is purified by clay and water; the river is purified by its current; the woman of uhclean mind by menstruation; and Brāhmaṇas by renunciation.
The limbs are purified by water; the mind is purified by truthfulness; the soul proper by learning and austerity; and cognition is purified by knowledge.
Thus has been explained to you the rule regarding bodily purification; listen now to the rule regarding the purification of various substances.—(109.)
Of igneous substances, of gems and of everything made of stone,—the purification has been ordained to be accomplished by means of ash, by water and by clay.
A golden vessel, free from stains, becomes pure by water alone; so also what is produced in water, what is made of stone and what is made of silver, if it is not enchased (or verse much defiled).
Gold and silver sprang out of the union of water and fire; for these reasons the purification of these two is best done by means of their source.—(112.)
Of copper, iron, brass, pewter and tin, the purification should be done, according to suitability, by means of alkaline substances, of liquid acids and of water.
For all liquids, purification has been declared to consist in throwing out a little; for solids, in sprinkling; and for wooden articles, in scraping.
During sacrificial performance there should be cleaning of the sacrificial vessels; the purification of spoons and cups is accomplished by washing;
Of grains and cloth, in large quantities, there is sprinkling with water; and in small quantities, their purification has been ordained to be secured by means of washing with water.
The method of purifying leather and tree-barks is similar to that of clothes; and for vegetables, roots and fruits, the purification is like that of grains.
Of Silken and woolen stuffs, by means of saline earth; of blankets by soap-berries; of ‘aṃśupaṭṭa,’ by the Bel-fruit; and of linen by white mustard.
The learned man should purify conch-shells, horn and things mads of bone and tusk, like linen; and by c ow’s urine or water.
Grass and wood and straw become pure by sprinkling; the house by sweeping and sprinkling; and an earthen pot by re-baking.
An earthen vessel which has been defiled by spirituous liquor, urine, ordure, saliva, pus or blood cannot be purified by another burning.
By cleaning and smearing, by sprinkling and by scraping, and by the lodging of cows—by these five land become purified.
What has been eaten by a bird, what has been smelt by a cow, blown upon, or sneezed at, or defiled by hair and insects, becomes pure by scattering earth.
From an object tainted by an unclean substance, as long as the smell and the stain caused by it do not disappear, so long should earth and water be applied to it,—in all cases of the purification of things.
The gods ordained three things pure for the Brāhmaṇas: what is not seen, what is washed with water and what is commended by word.
Water collected on the ground is pure, if it is sufficient to allay the thirst of the cow; but only if it is not contaminated by any unclean thing, becoming affected by with its smell, colour and taste.
The artisan’s hand is always pure; so also is merchandise spread out for sale; the food begged and held by the student is ever sacred; such is the established rule
The mouth of women is always pure; as also the bird in the dropping of fruits; the calf is pure in causing the flow (of milk); and the dog is pure in the catching of deer
The flesh of the animal killed by dogs Manu has declared to be pure; as also that of the animal killed by other carnivorous animals and by the Cāṇḍāla and other low castes.
The cavities that are above the navel are all pure; those that are below it are impure; as, also are all excretions dropped fr om the body.
Flies, water-drops, shadow, the cow, the horse, the sun’s rays, dust, earth, air and fire—should be regarded as pure to the touch.
For the cleansing of the ejectors or urine and faeces, earth and water should be used, as much as may be necessary; as also in the twelve cleansings of the bodily excretions.
Fat, man, blood, marrow, urine, ordure, nasal excretion, eab-wax, phlegm, tears, rheum of the eyes and perspiration,—these twelve are the ‘excretions’ of human beings.
One who desires cleanliness should apply earth—once to the urinary organ, thrice to the anus, ten times to one hand and seven times to both hands.
Such is the purification for householders; double of this for students, treble for hermits, and quadruple for renunciates.
Having passed urine or faeces, and sipped water, one should touch. with water the cavities; also when he may be going to read the Veda, and always when going to take food.
Desiring bodily purification, one should sip water thrice; then he should twice wipe his mouth; but the woman and the śūdra should each do it once only.
By śūdras living according to law, shaving should be done every month; thus manner of purification should be like that of the Vaiśya; and their food shall consist of the leavings of twice-born men.
Drops from the mouth, if they do not reach the body, do not make one impure; nor the hairs of the beard that enter the mouth; nor what adheres to the teeth.
The drops that touch the feet of one who is helping others to wash should be regarded as on the same footing as those on the ground; and he is not rendered impure by them.
He who, with some substance in hand, happens to be touched by an unclean object, becomes pure by washing, without laying down that substance.
Having vomitted or purged, one should bath and then eat clarified butter. After having eaten his food, he should only sip water. For one who has copulated bathing has been ordained.
One should sip water after having slept, after having sneezed, after having eaten, after having spat, after having told a lie, after having drunk water, and when going to read the Veda, even though he may be quite pure.
Thus has the whole rule regarding cleanliness and purification of substances for all castes been expounded to you; listen now to the duties of women.
Whether she be a child, or a young woman, or an aged woman, she should not do any act by herself, even in the house.
In childhood she should remain under the control of her father, in youth under that of her husband, and on the husband’s death under that of her sons; the woman should never have recourse to independence.
She should not seek separation from her father, husband or sons: by separating, the woman would render both families disreputable.
She should be always cheerful and alert in household-work; she should have the utensils well-cleaned and in spending she should be close-fisted.
Him to whom her father may give her,—or her brother with the father’s permission,—she shall attend upon as long as he lives, and shall not disregard him when he is dead.
At their wedding, the sacrifice to Prajāpati, which is the means of securing welfare, is performed for the purpose of procuring good fortune; it is the giving away that is the source of ownership.
The husband who has performed the mantric sacramental rites for women is the imparter of happiness to them both in season and out of season, here as well as in the next world.
Be he ill-mannered or of licentious habits or destitute of good qualities,—the husband should always be attended upon like a god by the true wive.
There is no separate sacrificing for women, no observances, no fastings; it is by means of serving her husband that she becomes exalted in heaven.
The good wife, desirous of reaching her husband’s regions, should never do anything that m ay be disagreeable to her husband, alive or dead.
Well might she macerate her body by means of pure flowers, roots and fruits; but she should not even mention the name of another man, after her husband is dead
Till her death, she should remain patient, self-controlled and chaste,—seeking that most excellent merit that accrues to women having a single husband.
Many thousands of unmarried Brāhmaṇa students have gone to heaven, without having perpetuated their race
On the death of her husband, the good wife who remains firm, goes to heaven, even though childless; just like those students
That woman, however, who from a longing for a child, disregards her husband, brings disgrace to herself in this world and falls off from her place in the other world.
What is born of another is not a ‘child’: nor is one begotten on another man’s wife; for good women a second husband is nowhere ordained.
She, who, having abandoned her own husband who is inerior, has recourse to another person who is superior, becomes contemptible in this world and is called a ‘remarried woman.’
The woman, who, through failure in her duty to her husband, becomes an object of contempt in the world, comes to be born as a jackal and is tormented by foul diseases.
She, who does not fail in her duty to her husband, having her thought, speech and body well-controlled, reaches her husband’s regions; and is called ‘good’ by all gentle-men.
The twice-born man, knowing the law, should cremate the wife of his own caste,—who behaves herself in the said manner, and dies before him,—with the sacred fire and along with the sacrificial implements.
Having, during the last rites, given away the sacred fires to his wife who died before him, he may marry again and kindle the fires again.
In this manner, one shall not omit the Five Sacrifices; and during the second part of his life, he shall take to a wife and dwell in the house.
The twice-born accomplished student, having, in the afore- said manner, lived, according to law, the life of the householder, should dwell in the forest, in the proper manner, self-controlled and with his organs under subjection
When the householder notices his wrinkles and greyness, and sees his child’s child,—then he should r etire to the forest,
Having given up cultivated food and all his belongings, he shall repair to the forest, either making over his wife to his sons, or along with her.
Taking with him the Sacred Fire, as also all the ritualistic appurtenances of the Fire, the man shall go forth from the village to the forest and live there, with his senses under control.
These same ‘Great Sacrifices’ he should offer, according to rule, with various kinds of pure food fit for hermits, or with herbs, roots and fruits.
He should wear either skin or a bit of cloth; he shall bathe in the evening, as also in the meaning; he shall always wear matted locks, as also beard, hair on his body and nails.
What he eats, cut of that he should make the offerings and give alms, according to his capacity; and those who come to his hermitage he should honour with water, roots and fruits and alms
He should be always engaged in Vedic study, meek, conciliatory, quiet, ever liberal, not accepting any gifts, and compassionate towards all living beings.
He shall offer, according to rule, the sacrificial oblations, taking case not to omit the ‘Darśa’ and the ‘Paurnamāsa’ sacrifice.
He shall perform the Darśeṣṭi and the Āgrayaṇa; as also the Cāturmāsya sacrifices, and the Turāyaṇa and Dākṣāyaṇa in due order.
With the pure grains fit for hermits, which grow in spring and in autumn, and which he has himself gathered, he shall severally prepare cakes and boiled messes, according to law
Having offered to the gods that most pure offering consisting of wild-growing things, he shall take to himself the remnant, as also the salt prepared by himself
He should eat the vegetables that grow on land and in water; also flowers, roots and fruits, the productions of pure trees; as well as oils produced from fruits.
He shall avoid honey, meat, cabbages, mushrooms, the fragrant grass, the pot-herb and the ‘Śleṣmātaka (Śleśmātaka?)’ fruits.
In the month of Āśvina he shall throw away the formerly-gathered ‘hermit’s food’, as also the worn-out clothes and the herbs, roots and fruits.
He shall not eat anything produced by ploughing, even though it mat have been thrown away by some one; nor such flowers and fruits as are grown in villages, even though he in be in distress.
He may be one living on food cooked by fire, or one eating only what Ripens in its own time; he may use the stone for grinding or he may use his teeth as the mortar.
He may be either one who washes off immediately, or one who lays by for a month, or one who lays by for six months, or one who lays by for a year.
Having collected food to the best of his ability, he should eat it at night, or during the day; or he may do it at every fourth time, or at every eighth time.
Or he may live during the bright and dark fortnights in th e manner of the ‘Cāndrāyaṇa’ penance; or he may eat once at the end of each of the two fortnights, boiled barley-gruel.
Or, he may always subsist only on flowers, roots and fruits, which have ripened in their own season and fallen down spontaneously,—keeping firm in the ways of life prescribed in the ‘Vaikhānasa’ Institutes.
He shall roll about on the ground, or stand on tip-toe during the day; he shall beguile his time by standing and sitting, going to water at the ‘Savanas’.
During summer he shall keep five fires; during the rains, he shall have the sky for his shelter; and during the winter he shall keep wet clothes: gradually increasing his austerities.—(23 ).
Bathing at the three Savanas, he shall offer libations to the gods and Pitṛs; and practising harsher and harsher austerities, he shall emaciate his body.
Haying reposited, according to rule, the Śrauta Fires within himself, he shall be a silent hermit, without fires and without a house, living upon roots and fruits.
Making no effort to obtain pleasure-giving objects, and maintaining celibacy, he shall sleep on the ground; and not caring for shelter, he shall have the roots of trees for his dwelling.
He shall receive alms just enough for subsistence, only from brāhmaṇa-hermits, or from such twice-born householders as live in the forests.
While dwelling in the forest, he may bring food from the village,—receiving it either in his hollowed hand or in a potsherd,—and eat eight morsels.
The Brāhmaṇa dwelling in the forest shall attend to these and other restraints; and also to the several Vedic texts contained in the Upaniṣads, in order to attain the Self.
Such of these as have been attended to by sages and Brāhmaṇa householders, for the advancement of knowledge and austerities, and also for the purification of the body
Or, having fixed upon the North-Easterly direction, he shall go forward, moving straight on, intent and living upon water and air,—till the falling off of his body.
Having discarded his body by one of these methods adopted by the Great Sages, the Brāhmaṇa, with sorrow and fear departed, becomes exalted in the region of Brahman.
Having thus passed the third part of his life in the forest, the man shall, during the fourth part, renounce all attachments and go forth (a wandering mendicant).
If one, after passing from stage to stage and after offering the sacrifices, with senses subdued, tired of alms and offerings,—goes forth as a wandering mendicant, and then dies, then he prospers.
One shall turn his mind towards Liberation only after having paid off the three debts; without having paid them, if he seeks for Liberation, he sinks downwards.
After having studied the Vedas according to rule, having begotten sons in the rightful manner, and having offered sacrifices to the rest of his ability,—he shall turn his mind towards Liberation.
The twice-born person, who seeks Liberation, without having studied the Vedas, without having begotten offspring, and without having offered sacrificis, sinks downwards.
Having performed the Prājāpatya Sacrifice, wherein all his belongings are given away as the sacrificial fee,—and having reposited the Fires within himself,—the Brāhmaṇa should go forth from his house.
He who goes forth from home after having granted freedom from all fear to all beings,—to that expounder of the Veda belong regions of light.
The twice-born person, from whom not the slightest danger arises to living beings, suffers no danger from any source, when he has become freed from his body.
Having departed from his house, fully equipped with the sacred things, he shall go forth, silent and wholly indifferent towards pleasures that may be presented to him.—(41.)
He shall always wander about alone, without a companion, in order to attain success; when one realises that success accrues to the solitary man, he neither forsakes nor becomes forsaken.
He shall be without fires and without home; he may go to a village for food;—disinterested, steady, silent and calmly-disposed.
The potsherd, the roots of trees, coarse cloth, solitude, e quality towards all,—are the mark of the liberated man.
He shall not rejoice at death; nor shall he rejoice at life; he shall await his time, just as the servant awaits the fulfilment of his contract
He shall place his foot sight-purified, drink water cloth-clarified, utter speech truth-sanctified and act with pure mind
He shall patiently bear improper words, and shall not insult anyone; and he shall not make enmity with any one, for the sake of his present body
Towards an angry man he shall not retort in anger; when he is cursed, he shall pronounce a blessing; and he shall not utter an untrue word, spreading over the seven openings.
Centered in spirituality, disinterested, free from longings, with himself as his sole companion, he shall wander forth in the world, seeking bliss.
He shall never obtain alms either by means of prodigies and portents, or by means of the science of astrology and palmistry, or by means of counsel and discussion.
He shall not go near a house that is filled by hermits, brāhmaṇas, birds, dogs or other mendicants
His hair, nails and beard clipped, equipped with vessels, staffs and water-pot, he shall constantly wander about, self-controlled and not causing pain to any living brings.
His vessels shall be non-metallic and free from holes; the cleansing of there has been ordained to be done by water, just like that of the vessels at a sacrifice.
Manu, the son of Svayambhu, has declared that the vessels of the renunciate shall be a gourd, a vessel of wood or of earthenware, or of splits.
He shall go for alms only once, and shall not seek for a large quantity; because the renunciate who becomes addicted to collecting alms becomes attached to sensual objects also.
The renunciate shall go for begging alms at a time when there is no smoke issuing, when the pestle has ceased to ply, when fire embers have been extinguished, when people have eaten, and when the removal of the dishes has been finished.
He shall not be sorry at not obtaining alms; nor shall he rejoice at obtaining it; he shall have only what suffices to sustain his life, and be free from all attachment to his accessories.
He shall disdain all honorific presents; by honorific presents the Renunciate, even though liberated, becomes fettered
By eating little food and by standing and sitting in solitude, he shall restrain his senses, when attracted by sensual objects.
By the restraining of the senses, by the destruction of love and hatred, and by not injuring living beings, he becomes fit for immortality.
He should reflect upon the conditions of men, arising from the defects of their deeds, their falling into hell and their sufferings in the abode of the death-god.
On the separation of loved ones and the meeting of hated persons; on being beset with decrepitude and suffering from diseases.
There is for his Inner Soul departure from the body, then again birth in the womb, and transmigrations among millions of life-forms.
On the infliction of pain upon living beings, caused by demerit; as also upon the imperishable union with happiness proceeding from the essence of merit.
By meditation he shall recognise the subtile character of the Higher Self, as also the possibility of its presence in all organisms, high and low.
Even though he be adorned, the man should fulfil his duty, to whichever order he may belong. He should be equal to all beings; mere external marks are not conducive to merit.
Though the fruit of the Kataka tree clarifies water, yet water does not become clear by the mere mention of its name.
With a view to the safety of living beings, he shall always, during day and night, even during bodily illness, walk after having scanned the ground.
By day and by night, if the Renunciate unintentionally injures some living creatures, he shall, for the purpose of expiating it, bathe and then perform six ‘breath-suspensions.’
Even three ‘breath-suspensions,’ accompanied by the three ‘vyāhṛti’-syllables and the syllable ‘om’, when duly performed, should be regarded as the highest austerity for the Brāhmaṇa.
Just as the impurities of metallic ores are consumed when they are blasted, even so are the taints of the senses consumed through the suspension of breath.
By means of ‘Breath-suspension’ he shall destroy the taints; and by means of ‘Concentration,’ all sin; all attachments by means of ‘Abstraction,’ and by means of ‘Contemplation,’ those attributes that are not independent.
By the practice of meditation he shall recognise the presence of this Inner Soul in all beings, high and low,—which is difficult to understand by unregenerate people.
Equipped with true insight, he is no longer fettered by his acts; but destitute of insight, he falls into the cycle of births and deaths.
By abstention from injuring, by the non-attachment of the senses, by the acts prescribed in the Veda, by the rigorous practising of austerities, they attain the position of That Being.
He shall discard this abode of material substances, where the bones are the pillars, which is held together by the tendons, plastered with flesh and blood; covered with the skin, foul-smelling, and full of urine and ordure; beset with wrinkles and sorrow, the seat of disease, harassed, sullied with passions and perishable.
He, who leaves this body, either as the tree leaves the bank, or as the bird leaves the tree, becomes freed from the shark of misery.—(78.)
Having, by the practice of meditation, attributed what is agreeable to him, to his good acts, and what is disagreeable, to his evil acts, he reaches the eternal Brahman.
When, by disposition, he becomes free from longing for all things, then he obtains lasting happiness in this world, as also after death.
Having, in this manner, gradually renounced all attachments, he becomes freed from all pairs of opposites, and reposes in Brahman alone.
All this that has been declared here is appurtenant to Meditation; he who does not realise and cultivate the said mental attitude does not obtain the reward of the acts.
He shall constantly recite Vedic texts bearing upon sacrifices, those dealing with deities and those dealing with the Soul, which have been called ‘Vedānta.’
This is the refuge for the ignorant, this for the learned; this for those seeking heaven, and this also for those desiring immortality.
The twice-born person, who, by this successive process, goes forth (as a mendicant), shakes off evil and attains the Supreme Brahman.
Thus have the duties of the self-controlled Renunciates been expounded to you. Listen now to the duties of the ‘renouncers of the Veda.’
The student, the Householder, the Hermit and the Renunciate,—all these, several stages emanate from the Householder. But all these, when observed in due order, a ccording to the scriptures lead the Brāhmaṇa who has (thus) acted according to the law, to the highest state.
Among all these however, in accordance with the injunction or the direct Vedic text, the Householder is declared to be the best; because he supports the other three.
Just as rivers and rivulets attain their resting-places in the Ocean, so do men of all other orders obtain support in the Householder.
By twice-born men belonging to all these four orders this ten-fold duty shall always be assiduously observed.
Steadiness Forgiveness, Self-control, Abstention from unrighteous appropriation, Purity, Control of the Sense-organs, Discrimination, Knowledge, Truthfulness, and Absence of anger,—these are the ten-fold forms of duty.
Those Brāhmaṇas, who properly study the ten forms of duty, and having studied them, follow them in practice, reach the highest state.
The twice-born person, performing, with collected mind, the ten-fold Duty, and having duly learnt the Vedānta texts, and become free from debts, should take to Renunciation.
Having renounced all acts, and thrown off the taint of his acts, and studied the Veda with mind self-oontrolled, he shall live at ease under the protection of his son.
Having thus renounced all rites, intent upon his own duty, free from longings, he destroys sin by his renunciation and attains the highest state.
Thus has the fourfold duty of the Brāhmaṇa been expounded to you, which is conducive to imperishable rewards after death. Now listen to the duty of Kings.—(97.)
I am going to expound the duties of Kings; how the Lord of Men should conduct himself, how he came into existence and how excellent success accrues to him.
The protection of all this shall be done according to law, by the Kṣatriya who has received the Vedic training in due form.
At a time when the people were without a King, and were utterly perturbed through fear, the Lord created the King for the protection of all this; taking out the essential constituents of Indra, Vāyu, Yama, Sūrya, Varuṇa, Chandra and Kubera
In as much as the King was created with the constituent elements of these principal Gods, he surpasses all living beings by his glory.
Like the sun, he burns the eyes and minds (of man); no one on the earth can even gaze at him.
On account of his puissance he is Agni, Vāyu and Sūrya; he is Soma and Yama; he is Kubera, he is Varuṇa and he is Indra.
Even though an infant, the King shall not be despised as if he were merely human; because he is a great divinity in human form.
Fire burns only one man who may happen to approach it carelessly; the fire of the King, on the other hand, consumes the entire family, along with its cattle and hoard of wealth.
For the proper fulfilment of his duty, he assumes many forms re peatedly, after having carefully considered the nature of his business, his power and the conditions of time and place.
He indeed contains in himself the splendour of all, in whose favour dwells the Goddess of Fortune, in whose valour rests victory and in whose anger abides death.
He, who, through folly, is hostile towards him, doubtlessly perishes; because the King makes up his mind for his quick destruction.
For this reason no one should transgress that favourable decree which the King should ordain in favour of his favourites, or that unfavourable decree that he should ordain against those in his disfavour.
For his sake, the Lord, at first, created Punishment, which is Law born of the Lord Himself, an incarnation of divine glory and the protector of all creatures.
It is through fear of him that all living beings, movable as well as immovable, go to subserve the experiences (of men) and do not swerve from their duties.
To men who act unlawfully, he shall mete it out appropriately, having carefully considered the time and place, as also the strength and learning.
That punishment is the ‘King’, the ‘Man’; that is the ‘Leader’ and the ‘Ruler’ and that has been declared to be the ‘surety’ for the Law of the Four Stages.
Punishment governs all creatures; Punishment alone protects them; Punishment lies awake while all are asleep; the wise regard Punishment as Law itself.
When meted out properly after due investigation, it makes all people happy; but when meted out without due investigation, it destroys all things.
If the King did not untiringly mete out punishment to those that deserve punishment, the stronger would have boasted the weaker, like fish, on the spit;
The crow would eat the Sacrificial Cake, and the dog would lick the offering-materials; rights of ownership would not remain with any one and there would be a confusion among the high and low.
It is by punishment that all people are kept under control; for an absolutely guileless man is hard to find; it is through fear of punishment that the world subserves the experiences (of men).
It is only when pressed by Punishment that Devas, Dānavas, Gandharvas, Rākṣasas, Birds and Reptiles subserve the experiences (of others).
All the castes would become corrupt, all barriers would be broken through, and there would be disruption among all the regions,—if there were any mistakes in regard to punishment.
Where dark-complexioned and red-eyed Punishment stalks about, destroying sins, there the people are not misled, provided that the Governor discerns rightly.
They declare that King to be the just governor who is truth ful of speech, who acts after due consideration, who is wise and who knows the essence of virtue, pleasure and wealth.
The King who metes out punishment in the proper manner prospers in respect of his three aims; he who is blinded by affection, unfair, or mean is destroyed by that same punishment.
Punishment, which is a tremendous force, hard to be controlled by persons with undisciplined minds, destroys the King who has swerved from duty, along with his relatives.
Then it will afflict his fortress and kingdom, the world along with movable and immovable things, as also the sages and the gods inhabiting the heavenly regions.
Punishment cannot be justly administered by one who has no assistant, or who is demented, or who is avaricious, or whose mind is not disciplined, or who is addicted to sensual objects.
Punishment can be administered by one who is pube, who is true to his word, who acts according to the Law, who has good assistants and is wise.
In his own kingdom he shall be of just behaviour, and on his enemies he shall inflict rigorous chastisement; with loved friends he shall be straightforward and towards Brāhmaṇas tolerant.
For the King who behaves thus, even though he may subsist up on gleanings, his fame spreads in the world, like the drops of oil on water.
But for the King who deviates from it having no control over himself, his fame diminishes in the world, like the drop of clarified butter on water.
The King has been created the protector of all castes and orders, who, in due order, are intent upon their respective duties.
Whatever should be done by him and his servants, for the protecting of his people, all that I am going to explain to you precisely and in due order
After rising in the morning, the King shall wait upon the Brāhmaṇas, who are accomplished students of the Threefold Science and learned; and shall follow their advice.
Every day he shall wait upon elderly persons, Brāhmaṇas, pure and learned in the Vedas; he who constantly waits upon elderly persons is honoured even by Rākṣasas.
Though his mind be already disciplined, he shall always learn discipline from them; the King with a disciplined mind never perishes.
Many Kings, along with their belongings, have perished through want of discipline; while, on account of discipline, many, even though living in forests, have obtained Kingdoms.
It was through want of discipline that Vena perished, as also King Nahuṣa, Sudās, Paijavana, Sumukha and Nimi.
But through discipline Pṛthu and Manu obtained kingdoms, Kubera obtained the lordship of wealth and the son of Gādhi attained Brāhmaṇahood.
From persons learned in the Threefold Science he shall learn the Triad; as also the ancient Science of Government, the Science of Reasoning and the Science of the Soul; and also the art of commerce from experts
Day and night he shall put forth an effort to subdue his senses; because he whose senses are subjugated is capable of keeping his subjects under control.
He shall shun the ten ruinous vices springing from love of plea sure, as also the eight arising from anger.
The king who is addicted to vices springing from the love of pleasure becomes deprived of wealth and virtue; while he who is addicted to those proceeding from anger becomes bereft of his very soul.
Hunting, dice, sleeping during the day, censoriousness, women, intoxication, musical triad and listless wandering constitute the ten-fold set arising from the love of pleasure.
Tale-bearing, Treachery, Envy, Slandering, Misappropriation of property, Cruelty of speech and of Assault;—these constitute the eightfold set born of Anger.
With great effort he shall subdue that Greediness which all wise men regard as the root of both these; both these sets arise out of that.
In the set arising from love of pleasure,—drinking, dice, women and hunting are to be regarded as the four most pernicious, in the order in which they are named.
In the set born of Anger,—Assault, Cruelty of speech and Misappropriation of property,—are to be regarded as the three most pernicious.
The self-disciplined man should know that in this set of seven which spreads everywhere, each preceding vice is more serious than the succeeding one.
Between Vice & Death, Vice is said to be more harmful; the vicious man sinks down and down; but the dead man, without vices, ascends to heaven.
He shall appoint seven or eight ministers, with respectable status, versed in law, of heroic temperament, experienced in business, born of noble families, and thoroughly tested.
Even an undertaking that is easy is difficult to be accomplished by a single man, specially by one who has no assistant; how much more so is the work of the king, which involves great issues!
With these he shall always discuss all ordinary business relating to peace and war, as also the ‘state’, the sources of revenue, the means of protection, and the consolidation of what has been acquired.
Having ascertained the opinion of each of the ministers individually and also collectively, he shall, in his affairs, do what is beneficial to himself.
With the learned Brāhmaṇa, however, who is the most distinguished of them all, the king shall discuss the highest secrets pertaining to the six-fold state-craft.
He shall always, in full confidence, entrust all business to him; and having, in consultation with him, formed his resolution, he shall do what has to be done.
He shall also appoint other ministers, who are pure, wise, firm, experts in collecting revenue and thoroughly tested.
He shall appoint as many industrious, clever and skilful men as may be required for the accomplishment of his business.
From among them he shall employ the brave, the expert, the high-born and the honest ones in work relating to finance,—such as mines and stores—and timid ones in the interior of the palace.
As ambassador he shall appoint one who is well versed in all the sciences, who understands hints, expressions and gestures, who is honest, expert and born of a noble family.
That royal ambassador is commended who is loyal, honest, clever, possessed of good memory, conversant with place and time, handsome of body, fearless and eloquent.
The army is dependent upon the minister (of war); on the army rests the act of ruling; the treasury and the realm are dependent upon the king, and upon the ambassador depend peace and its opposite.
For it is the Ambassador alone who brings together allies and also alienates them; the Ambassador transacts that business by which people become disunited
In connection with the business of the foreign king, he should explore, by means of secret hints and transactions, the expression, the hints and the transactions among his servants, as also the intentions of the king himself.
He shall live in a city, taking up his residence either in a ‘bow-fort’, or in an ‘earthen fort’, or in an ‘aquatic fort,’ or in an ‘arborial fort,’ or in a ‘human fort,’ or in a ‘hilly fort.’
By all means in his power he shall take shelter in a ‘hilly fort’; because among all these (forts) the hilly fort is distinguished by many good qualities.
Just as enemies do not hurt these beings sheltered in their fortresses, so also the enemies do not injure the king protected by his fort.
A single bow-man, standing on a rampart, can fight against a hundred; and a hundred can fight against ten thousand; it is for the season that fortification has been enjoined.
It should be folly equipped with weapons, with money and grain, with conveyances, with Brāhmaṇas, with artisans, with machines, with fodder and with water,
In the centre of the fort, he shall get built for himsrlf a spacious palace, well guarded, equipped with all seasons, resplendent, and supplied with water and trees.
Having occupied it, he shall wed a wife of the same caste as himself, who is equipped with auspicious signs, born in a noble family, charming, and possessed of beauty and excellent qualities.
He shall appoint a household priest and select officiating priests; they shall perform his domestic rites, as also the fire-sacrifices.
The King shall offer various sacrifices at which large sacrificial fees are paid; and for the purpose of acquiring merit, he shall provide for Brāhmaṇas luxuries and riches.
He should cause the yearly revenue to be collectbd by trusted men. In his business he shall stick to the scriptures; and towards the people he shall behave like a father.
Here and there he shall appoint several proficient inspectors; they shall supervise all the acts of men working for him.
He shall do honour to those Brāhmaṇas who have returned from their teacher’s house; for kings, this is interminable; and has been called ‘Brahmic treasure’.
Neither thieves, nor enemies take it away; nor does it perish; hence this inexhaustible treasure shall be deposited by the king with the Brāhmaṇas.
What is offered into the mouth of the Brāhmaṇa, which is neither spilt nor spoilt, nor wasted, is far superior to the Fire-offerings.
The gift to a non-Brāhmaṇa is equable; that to a nominal Brāhmaṇa is twofold; that to the Teacher, a hundred-thousand-fold and that to a person thoroughly learned in the Veda, endless.
For one obtains, after death, the reward, small or great, of his gifts,—according to the peculiar character of the recipient, and also according to his own faith.
That substance is conducive to merit which is given to a proper recipient, in good faith and in due accordance with time and place and form.—(86b)
While protecting his people, if the king is challenged by enemies, either equal in strength, or stronger, or weaker, he shall not shrink from battle, bearing in mind the duty of the kṣatriya.
Not shrinking from battle, protecting the people, and attending on brāhmaṇas,—is the best means of securing happiness for kings.
Kings, seeking to slay each other in battle and fighting with gheat energy, without turning back, proceed to heaven.
While fighting his enemies in battle, he shall hot strike with concealed weapons; nor with arrows that are poisoned, or barbed, or with flaming shafts.
He shall hot strike one who is standing on the ground, nor one who is a eunuch, nor the supp?icant (supplicant?) with joined palms, nor one with loosened hair, nor one who is seated, nor one who says ‘i am yours;’
Nor one who is sleeping, nor him who is without his armour, nor one who is naked, nor one deprived of his weapons, nor one who is only looking on and not fighting, nor one who is engaged in fighting with ahother person;
Nor one who has fallen in difficulties regarding weapons; nor one in distress, nor one severely wounded, nor one who is frightened, nor one who has turned back;—the king remembering the duties of honourable men.
But the Kṣatriya who, frightened and turned back, is slain by the enemies, takes upon himself all the sin that there may be of his master.
And whatever merit the man slain after having turned back may have earned for the next world,—all that his master takes off.
Chariots and horses, elephants, umbrellas, wealth, grains, animals, women, all goods and baser metals belong to him who wins them.
They shall present to the King the choice portion,—such is the Vedic declaration. what has not been won individually shall be distributed by the king among all the soldiers.
Thus has been declared the blameless eternal law of warriors; the Kṣatriya, striking his enemies in battle, shall not deviate from this law.
He shall strive to obtain what has not been obtained; what he has gained he shall preserve with care; he shall augment what has been preserved and what has been augmented he shall bestow upon suitable recipients
He shall recognise the four kinds of the means for accomplishing the purposes of man; and he shall always diligently and properly carry them into execution;
He shall have his force always operative; his manliness always displayed, his secrets constantly concealed, ever following up the weak points of his enemy.
Of him who has his force constantly operative, the whole world stands in awe. He shall, therefore, subdue all men by means of force
He shall always behave without guile, and never with guile; well protected himself, he shall fathom the guiles employed by his enemies.
His enemy should hot know his weak points, but he must know the weak points of the enemy; he should hide the departments (of government) as the tortoise does its limbs; and he should guard his own weak points.
He shall ponder over his plans like the heron, and like the lion he shall exert his power; he shall snatch like the wolf, and like the hare he shall double in retreat.
While he is thus engaged in conquest, if there should be any opponents for him, all these he shall bring under subjugation by means of conciliation and other expedients.
If however they should not be stopped by means of the first three expedients, then he shall gradually bring them under subjection by force.
For the prosperity of kingdoms the wise ones always recommend Conciliation and Force from among the four expedients, conciliation and the rest.
Just as the weeder plucks out the weed and preserves the corn, so shall the King preserve his kingdom and destroy his opponents.
The King, who, through folly, thoughtlessly oppresses his kingdom, becomes, ‘along with his relations’, deprived, without delay, of his kingdom and life.
As the lives of living beings perish by the emasciation of their bodies, so do the lives of Kings perish by oppressing their kingdom
In the administration of his kingdom he shall adopt the procedure described below; for the king, whose kingdom is properly administered, prospers easily.
In the midst of two, three, five or hundred villages he shall appoint an administrator of state supplied with a picket of guards.
He shall appoint the lord of one village, as also the lord of ten villages, the lord of twenty, the lord of hundred and the lord of thousand villages.
Troubles arising in the village, the Village-lord shall himself gently report to the Lord of Ten villages; and the Lord of Ten villages to the Lord of Twenty;—the Lord of Twenty shall communicate it all to the Lord of Hundred; and the Lord of Hundred himself shall report it to the Lord of Thousand.
The Village-lord shall get daily those things that ought to be furnished to the King by the villagers, in the shape of food, drink, fuel and the rest.
The Lord of Ten villages shall enjoy one Kula and the Lord of Twenty villages twenty Kulas; the Lord of Hundred villages one whole village and the Lord of Thousand villages one town.
The affairs of these officers pertaining to the villages, as also their individual affairs another minister of the King shall inspect, who is loyal and never idle.
In each town he shall appoint one Superintendent of all works, of high status and awe-inspiring appearance,—he being like a planet among stars.
This officer shall always personally supervise in turn all those officers, and thoroughly acquaint himself, through the King’s spies, with their behaviour in their respective jurisdictions.
As the king’s servants, appointed to protect the people, generally become knaves, bent upon seizing the property of others,—he shall protect his people against them
Those evil-minded persons who would take money from men engaged in business—of these the King shall confiscate the whole property and ordain banishment.
For women employed in the King’s service and also for menial servants, he shall fix daily wages, in proportion to their position and work.
One paṇa shall be paid as the wages of the inferior, and six to the superior servant; as also clothing every sixth month and a Droṇa of grain every month.
He should make the traders pay duties, after due investigation of the details of buying and selling, the journey involved, fooding along with its accessories, and the measures of safety.
After due investigation the King shall always levy taxes in his kingdom in such a way that he himself and the man who carries on the business shall both receive their reward.
In the case of cattle and gold the fiftieth part shall be taken by the King; and in the case of grains, the eighth, sixth or twelfth part.
He shall take the sixth part in the case of trees, meat, honey and clarified butter, of perfumes, medicinal herbs and poisons, of flowers, roots and fruits; of leaves, vegetables and grasses, of skins and cane, of earthenware vessels, and of all things made of stone.
Even though dying, the King shall not levy a tax on the Śrotriya; and no Śrotriya living in his kingdom shall suffer from hunger.
The kingdom of that King in whose realm the Śrotriya suffers from hunger, shall, ere long, pine with hunger.
Having ascertained his learning and character, he shall provide for him a fair living; and he shall protect him against all things, even as the father protects his lawful son.
Protected by the King he performs meritorious acts day after dat; and by that the King’s life, wealth and kingdom become augmented.
The King shall make the other people living by business p ay during the year something under the name of “tax”.
Mechanics and Artisans, as also shudras who subsist by bodily labour,—the King shall make each of these work for one day every month.
He shall not cut off his own root, nor that of others, through excessive greed; by cutting off his own root he causes suffering to himself as well as to others.
The King shall be severe and mild, after having duly examined the work (of each man); it is only the severe-mild King who is highly respected.
When tired with looking after the affairs of men, he shall place in that place his chief minister, who is conversant with the law, wise, self-controlled, and born of a noble family.
Having thus arranged all his business, he shall protect his people, ever intent and watchful.
He, from whose territories people are carried off, screaming, by robbers, while he himself, along with his servants is looking on, is dead, not alive.
The protection of the people is the Kṣatriya’s highest duty; the King, who enjoys the fruits mentioned, becomes endowed with merit.
Having risen during the last watch of the night and performed his ablutions, with collected mind, having poured libations into the Fire, and honoured the Brāhmaṇas, he shall enter the auspicious Hall of Audience.
Staying there, he shall welcome all his subjects and then send them away. Having sent off all the people, he shall take counsel with his minister.
Having ascended the top of a hill, or a house, and retiring into solitude,—or in a desolate forst he shall hold counsel, unobserved.
That King, whose secret plans other people, coming together, do not know, enjoys the whole earth, even though he be poor in treasure.
At the time of taking counsel, he shall send away the idiot, the dumb and the deaf, animals, very aged persons, women, foreigners, the sick and the maimed.
Persons who have been disgraced, animals, and particularly women betray secret plans; hence he shall be careful with regard to them.
At mid-day or at mid-night, free from fatigue and dulness, he shall deliberate on matters relating to morality, pleasure and wealth, either with them, or alone by himself;
—also on the attainment of these, mutually irreconcilable as they are, on the giving away of daughters and on the guardianship of sons;
—or the sending of ambassadors, the remaining details of undertakings, on the affairs of the harem, and on the work of spies;
—also upon the entire ‘eight-fold business,’ and on the ‘five-fold group’ in its real character, on affection and disaffection, and on the conduct of his ‘circle’.
—on the conduct of the ‘intermediary’ oh the doings of the king bent upon conquest, on the action of the neutral king, as also that of his enemy, with special care.
These four components are, in brief, the root of the circle; eight others also have been described; these being the twelve that have been spoken op.
There are five others, the minister, the kingdom, the fortress, the treasury and the army—described in connection with each (of the above twelve); these then, briefly, being seventy-two.
He shall regard, as ‘enemy’, his immediate neighbour, as also the person who helps his enemy; the immediate neighbour of his enemy he shall regard as his ‘friend’; and as ‘neutral’ the king who is beyond those two.
All these he shall win over by means of conciliation and the other expedients, severally as well as collectively, as also by prowess and policy.
Alliance, War, March, Halt, Bifurcation and seeking shelter—these six measures of policy he shall constantly ponder over.
He shall have recourse to Halting, to Marching, to Alliance, to War, to Bifurcation or to Seeking shelter, after having fully considered his business.
But the King shall know that Alliance and War are of two kinds; so also both Marching and Halting; and Seeking shelter also has been declared to be of two kinds.
War has been declared to be of two kinds: that which is waged, in season or out of season, by oneself, for his own purpose, and that which is waged on some wrong done to an ally.
Marching is said to be of two kinds that undertaken by the king by himself alone, on the sudden approach of an emergent occasion, and that undertaken by him accompanied by his ally.
Halting has been declared to be of two kinds: that which is necessary for one who has become gradually weakened, either by chance or through previous acts, and that which is necessitated by considerations for his ally.
When, for the accomplishment of some purpose, the Master takes up one position and the Force another,—this is what is described as ‘Bifurcation’ by those conversant with the details of the six measures of policy.
‘Seeking shelter’, with noble people, has been declared to be of two kinds: that which is done for the sake of accomplishing a useful purpose, when harassed by enemies, and that in the form of a status.
When he knows that his superiority is certain in the future, and at the time there is but little harm done—then he should resort to peace.
But when he thinks all his people to be highly contented, and himself to be exceedingly prosperous,—then he shall make war.
When he thinks that his own army is happy and strong in condition, and that of the enemy is the reverse, then shall he march against the enemy
But when he happens to be weak in conveyances and soldiers, then he shall sit quiet, gradually conciliating his enemies with special care.
When the king thinks his enemy to be stronger in every respect, then he should bifurcate his force and thus accomplish his own purpose.
When he happens to be very much open to attack by the enemy’s forces, then he shall seek shelter with a r ighte ous and powerful King.
That king who does the chastisement of his people as also of his enemy’s army,—him he shall ever serve with every effort, like a preceptor.
If even there he should perceive something wrong on the part of his shelterer, then, even in that condition he shall, without hesitation, resort to war.
By means of all the expedients, the politic king shall act in such a manner that his allies, neutrals and enemies do not become superior to himself.
He shall fully think over the future and the present condition of all undertakings, as also the good and bad points of all past ones.
He, who is alive to the good and bad points in re gard to the future, is quick in his decisions relating to the present, and understands the consequences of his acts in the past, is never overpowered by his enemies.
He shall arrange everything in such a manner that his allies or neutrals or enemies may not get the better of him; this is the sum-total of state-policy.
When the king undertakes an expedition against the enemy’s kingdom, he shall advance slowly towards the enemy’s capital, in the following manner.
The king shall start on his expedition in the auspicious month of Mārgaśīrṣa, or towards the months of Phalguna and Caitra, according to the condition of his forces.
At other times also, if he perceives certain victory, then he shall pick up a quarrel and march forward; also when some trouble has arisen for the enemy.
Having duly made arrangements at the base, as also those pertaining to the expedition, having secured a basis, and having duly deputed his spies,—having cleared the three kinds of roads, and having equipped his own six-fold force,—he shall advance against the enemy’s capital in the manner prescribed for warfare.—(184-185)
He shall be very much on his guard against an ally who may be secretly serving the enemy, as also against one who has gone away and returned; as he is the more dangerous enemy.—(1 86)
He shall march on this road arraying his army in the form of a staff, or in that of a cart, or a boar, or an alligator, or a needle or the Garuḍa-bird.
From where he apprehends danger there he shall extend his forces; and he himself shall always encamp in the ‘lotus-array’
The Commander-in-Chief and the General he shall station in all directions; the quarter from which he apprehends danger, that he shall regard as the ‘East’ (Front).
On all sides he shall station reliable pickets, with whom signals have been arranged, who are experts in standing firm as also in charging, fearless and loyal.
He shall make a small number of men fight in close formation; but a large number he may extend as he likes. He shall make them fight, arraying them in the form of the ‘needle’ and the ‘thunderbolt.’
On even ground he shall fight with chariots and horses; on marshy ground with boats and elephants; on ground covered with trees and thickets with bows; and on firm ground with swords and shields and other weapons.
Men born in the countries of Kurukṣhtra, Matsya, Pañcāla, and Śūrasena.—he shall make these fight in the vanguard; as also those that are tall and light.
Having arrayed his forces, he shall encourage them and thoroughly test them; even while they are engaging the enemy, he shall mark their behaviour.
After having besieged the foe, he shall halt, and proceed to harass his kingdom and continually vitiate his supply of fodder, food, water and fuel.
He shall destroy the tanks, as also walls and ditches; he shall assail the enemy and shall frighten him—during the night.
He shall alienate all who are alienable, keep himself informed of the enemy’s doings, and when fate is propitious, he shall fight, devoid of fear and determined to co nquer.
By conciliation, by gifts and by dissension,—either severally or collectively,—he shall try to conquer his enemy,—never by war.
Since between two combatants victory is found to be uncertain, as also defeat,—therefore he shall avoid fighting
But in the event of the three aforesaid expedients failing, he shall fight in such a manner as to conquer his enemies completely.
Having gained victory, he shall worship the gods and the righteous Brāhmaṇas, grant remissions and proclaim amnesties.
Having briefly ascertained the wishes of all the people, he shall set up there a member of the same family and then conclude the treaty.
He shall make authoritative all that is declared to have been lawful (in the kingdom), and shall honor with precious gifts the king along with the leading men.
The seizing of desirable property is productive of displeasure, and the giving of it is productive of pleasure; each is commended if done at the proper time.
All this undertaking is dependent upon the ordering of Destiny and of Human Exertion; of these two, Destiny is incomprehensible, and action is possible only in regard to Human Exertion.
Or, having made peace with his enemy, he, may return, accompanied by the latter,—finding in this the due fulfilment of the threefold reward consisting of an ally, gold and territory.
Even though the land (occupied by him) be safe, fertile and conducive to the increase of cattle, yet he shall quit it,—not minding his own selfish interests.
He shall save his wealth for the sake of trouble; his wife he shall protect even with his wealth; and himself he shall constantly protect, even with his wife and his wealth.
Seeing all kinds of troubles frequently cropping up simutaneously, the wise person shall employ all the expedients, collectively as well as severally.
(a) The employer of the expedients, (b) the end to be attained by the expedients and (c) the expedients themselves,—taking his stand upon all these three, he shall strive for the accomplishment of his purpose.
Having thus discussed all this with his ministers, the king shall take exercise at midday; and having bathed, shall enter the inner apartment for the purpose of taking his food.
There he shall eat the food that has been thoroughly tested by such servants as are his own very self, as are conversant with the peculiarities of time, and are uncorruptible,—with such sacred texts as are destructive of poison,
He shall purify all his things by means of liquids destructive of poisons; and he shall be careful to wear always such gems as are antidotes against poison.
Thoroughly tested women, whose toilet and ornaments have been examined, shall serve him attentively with fans, water and incense.
He shall exercise similar caution with regard to conveyances, beds, seats and food, as also to bath, toilet and all kinds of ornaments
Having dined, he shall amuse himself in the inner apartment, in the company of the ladies; and having amused himself, he shall in due time again attend to business.
Duly robed, he shall again inspect the fighting men, as also all kinds of conveyances, weapons and accoutrements.
Having attended to his twilight devotions, he shall, well- armed, listen, in an inner room, to the doings of persons making eecret reports, and also of his spies.
Repairing to another apartment, and having dismissed those people, he shall again enter the inner apartment, surrounded by the women, for the purpose of taking his food.
Then, having eaten a little again, and having been recreated by the sound of musical instruments, he shall sleep and rise at the proper time, freed from fatigue.
The king, who is free from diseases, shall act up to this ordinance; but when indisposed, he shall entrust all this to his servants.
Desirous of investigating cases, the king shall enter the court, with a dignified demeanour, along with Brāhmaṇas and councillors, versed in counsel.
There, either seated or standing, raising his right hand, subdued in dress and ornaments, he shall look into the suits of the suitors.
He shall look into the suits—day after day, one by one,—falling as they do under eighteen heads,—according to principles deduced from local usage and from the scriptures.
Of these the first is Non-payment of Debt; (then) Deposits, Selling without ownership, Joint concerns, Non-delivery of what has been given away,—4 Non-payment of wages, Breach of Contract, Recision of Sale and Purchase, Dispute between the Owner and the Keeper,—5 Disputes regarding Boundaries, and Assault, physical and verbal, Theft, Violence, Adultery,—6 Duties of man and wife, Partition, and Gambling and Betting;—these are the eighteen topics that form the basis of law-suits.—(4-7)
Taking his stand upon eternal morality, he shall form his decision on the suits of men who mostly carry on disputes in regard to the aforesaid points.
When he himself may not carry on the investigation of suits, he shall appoint a learned Brāhmaṇa to do the work of investigation.
That man, accompanied by three assessors, shall enter the excellent Court, and either seated or standing, shall investigate the suits on behalf of the king.
That place, where three Brāhmaṇas learned in the Veda sit, as also the learned Brāhmaṇa appointed by the king,—they regard as the ‘Court of Brahman.’
In a court where Justice is pierced by Injustice, and the members of the Court do not remove that dart, these members also become pierced.
One should either not enter the Court at all, or he should speak out what is equitable; one who either spe aks nothing, or speaks falsely, becomes tainted with sin.
Where justice is destroyed by injustice, or truth by falsehood, while people are looking on,—there the members of the court also are destroyed.
Justice, blighted, blights; and justice, preserved, preserves; hence justice should not be blighted, lest blighted justice blight us.
For Justice is the revered ‘Vṛṣa,’ Bull; and he who commits the violation, ‘alam,’ of it, him the gods regard as ‘vṛṣala,’ low-born; hence one shall not violate Justice.
Morality (Justice) is the only friend who follows one even after death; everything else perishes along with the body.
One quarter of the Injustice falls on the man who commits it, one quarter on the witness, one quarter on the members of the Court and one quarter on the king.
Where, however, the person deserving of censure is actually censured, there the king becomes sinless, the members of the court become freed, and the sin falls upon the perpetrator.
Even a so-called Brāhmaṇa, who makes a living by his caste only, may, at pleasure be the propounder of the Law for the king,—but not a Śūdra under any circumtsances.
The kingdom or that king for whom the investigation of Law is done by a Śūdra, while he himself is looking on, suffers, like the cow in a morass.
That kingdom where there is a majority of Śūdras, which is infested with non-believers and destitute of twice-born people, quickly perishes entirely, becoming afflicted by famine and disease.
Having occupied the Judgment-seat, with his body covered and mind collected, he shall salute the Guardian-Deities, and then proceed with the investigation of suits.
Understanding both ‘desirable’ and ‘undesirable’ to be only ‘Justice’ and ‘Injustice,’ he shall look into all the suits of the suitors, according to the order of the castes.
He shall discover the internal disposition of men by external signs: by variations in their voice, colour and aspect, as also by means of the eye and by gestures.
The inner mind is indicated by such variations as those of aspect, gait, gesture, speech, and by changes in the eye and the face.
The king shall take care of the property owned by a minor, till such time as he may return from the teacher’s house, or till he may have passed his minority.
There shall be similar protection in the case of barren women, of son-less women, of women devoted to their husbands, and of widows faithful to their husbands,—when their family is extinct, and when they are in distress.
While these women are alive, if their relatives should appropriate their property,—on them the righteous king shall inflict the punishment of thieves.
Property, the owner whereof has disappeared, the King shall keep for three years; up to three years the owner may receive it; but after that the King (shall take it).
He who says ‘this is mine’ should be questioned in proper form; and the owner ought to receive the property after having correctly described the colour, the number and other details regarding it.
If he does not provide a correct account of the place and time, and also the colour, form and size of the lost article, he deserves a fine equal to that article.
Property that has been lost and found should remain in the charge of specially deputed (officials); and the thieves that he may detect in connection with this, the king shall cause to be killed by an elephant.
Out of the property that has been lost and found, the king, remembering the duty of good men, shall take the sixth part, or the tenth, or the twelfth.
In regard to a treasure-trove, if a man says truly ‘this is mine,’—from him the king shall take the sixth part, or only the twelfth part.
But he who speaks falsely shall, be fined the eighth part of his property, or a smaller fraction, on calculation, of that same treasure-trove.
A learned Brāhmaṇa, having found treasure buried by his forefathers, shall take it wholly; as he is the master of everything.
When the king himself finds a hoard buried of old under the ground, he shall give one-half of it to the Brāhmaṇas and have the other half put in his treasury.
Of ancient hoards, as also of minerals under the ground, the king is entitled to his share, by reason of his protecting them,—he being the lord of the soil.
Property stolen by thieves should be restored by the king to men of all castes; by retaining such property, the king imbibes the sin of the thief.
The king knowing his duty shall determine the law for each man, after haying duly examined the provincial laws pertaining to each caste, the law’s of guilds, as also the laws of families.
For men following their respective occupations,—even though living at a distance,—come to be liked by the people, while they remain firm in their own duties.
Neither the king himself nor any servant of his shall promote a suit; nor shall he suppress a suit that has been brought up by another person.
Just as the hunter discovers the foot-print of the deer by the drops of blood, so should the king discover the right by means of inference.
When engaged in judicial proceedings, the king shall keep his eye upon the truth, upon the object, upon himself, the witness and upon the place, the time and the aspect.
What may be found to have been observed in practice by the good and the righteous twice-born men, that he shall ordain for countries, families and castes,—provided that it is not antagonistic.
On being prayed by the creditor for the recovery of money from the debtor, he shall make the debtor pay to the creditor the money proved to be due.
Having determined the means by which the debtor may be able to get his money, he shall, by those same means, make the debtor pay up.
He shall make the advanced money repaid by means of ( a ) good faith, ( b ) tactful transaction, ( c ) trick, ( d ) moral pressure, and ( c ) force, the fifth.
The creditor who shall himself recover his money from the debtor should not be prosecuted by the king, for recovering what is his own property.
The man who denies a debt shall be made to pay the creditor’s due, proved by evidence, as also a small fine, according to his means.
On denial by the debtor, when asked in court to pay the debt, the complainant shall produce a witness, or adduce (other) evidence.
He who mentions the wrong place,—or who, having mentioned it, retracts,—or who does not understand that his previous and subsequent statements are contradictory;
He who, having put forward a statement, subsequently retracts; and who on being questioned regarding a fact (previously) duly alleged, does not support it;
He who secretly converses with the witnesses in a place not fit for conversation, or who does not like the question being investigated, or who falls back;
—He who, on being ordered to speak, does not speak; or who does not prove what he has asserted;—or who does not grasp the previous and subsequent statements;—such a person fails in that suit.
Having asserted that he has witnesses, and on being asked to name them, if he does not name them,—him also, on these grounds, the judge shall declare to have failed in his suit.
If the complainant does not speak out, he shall be imprisoned and pined, according to law. If the other party does not answer within three fortnights, he becomes defeated according to law.
If one falsely denies a debt, or if the other falsely demands it,—these two, proficient in dishonesty, should be made by the king to pay a fine double that sum.
On having been summoned and questioned, if one denies it,—then he siiall be convicted by the man seeking for his due by means of at least three witnesses, in the presence of the king and the brāhmaṇas.
I shall declare now what sort of persons should be made witnesses in suits by wealthy men, and how the truth should be told by them.
Householders, men with sons, respectable natives, and men of the kṣatriya, vaiśya and śūdra castes are competent to act as witnesses, when cited by suitors;—and not any and every person, except in emergencies.
In all law-suits trustworthy men of all the castes, fully conversant with morality and free from avarice, should be made witnesses; the reverse of these should be avoided.
Neither interested persons, nor relations, nor helpers, nor enemies, nor persons of proved corruption, nor those afflicted with disease, nor the corrupted should be made witnesses.
The king should not be made a witness; nor craftsmen, nor actors, nor a Vedic scholar, nor one in holy orders, nor one who has renounced all attachments.
—Not one wholly dependent, nor one under pupilage, nor a paid servant, nor one who adopts forbidden occupations, nor one too old, nor a minor, nor a single person, nor one belonging to the lowest class, nor one with defective organs;
—Nor one afflicted, nor one intoxicated, nor one demented, nor one tormented by hunger and thirst, nor one oppressed by fatigue, nor one tormented by love, nor one who is in a rage, nor a thief.
—Woman should give evidence for women; and for twice-born persons similar twice-born men, virtuous śūdhas for śūdras, and men of the lowest caste for the lowest men.
In the case of anything done in the interior of a house, or in a forest, or in the case of injury to the body,—any person who may be cognisant of the facts may give evidence on behalf of the parties to the suit.
In the event of (proper witnesses) not forthcoming, evidence may be given by a woman, by a minor, by an aged person, by a pupil, by a relative, by a slave, or by a servant.
In the event of minors, aged and diseased persons deposing falsely in their evidence, the Judge should make up his mind regarding the speech being irregular; so also in the case of men with disordered minds.
In all cases of violence, of theft and adultery, and of assault, verbal and corporeal,—he shall not investigate the character of the witnesses.
On a conflict among witnesses, the king shall accept the majority; in the case of equality (of number) those possessed of superior qualifications; and in the case of conflict between equally qualified witnesses, the best among the twice-born.
Evidence based upon what is directly seen and is heard is admissible; and a witness, telling the truth in such cases, does not fall off from spiritual merit or worldly prosperity.
A witness asserting, in an assembly of noble men, anything apart from what he has seen and heard, falls downwards into hell after death and becomes shut out from heaven.
Even though not put down as a witness, if a person happens to see or hear anything in regard to a case,—when he comes to be questioned about it, he should speak out exactly as he has seen or heard it.
A single man, free from covetousness, may be a witness, but not many women, even though pure,—because the understanding of women is not steady,—nor other men who are tainted with defects.
What the witnesses state naturally, in relation to the case, should be accepted; apart from this what they state from considerations of righteousness, is useless.
The investigating Judge shall question the witnesses assembled in the court, in the presence of the plaintiff and the defendant, gently exhorting them in the following manner.
‘What you know of the mutual transaction between these two persons regarding this suit,—all that may you declare freely; since you are witnesses in this matter.’
‘The witness, telling the truth in his evidence, attains irreproachable regions, also unsurpassable fame; such speech is honoured by Brahmā himself.’
‘Stating the untruth in his evidence, he becomes firmly bound in Varuṇa’s fetters, helpless during a hundred births. One should, therefore, give true evidence.’
‘By truth is the witness purified, by truth does merit grow: hence the truth should be spoken by witnesses of all castes.’
‘The soul itself is the soul’s witness, and the soul itself is the soul’s refuge; disregard not your soul, the best witness of man.’
‘The sinners indeed think that “no one sees us”; but the gods see them, as also their own inner personality.’
‘Heaven, earth, water, heart, moon, sun, fire, death-god, wind, night, the two twilights, and morality know the conduct of all corporeal beings.’
In the presence of gods and Brāhmaṇas, during forenoon, the judge, pure himself, shall ask the twice-born persons, who have been purified and are facing either the north or the east, to give evidence.
He shall question the Brāhmaṇa with the word ‘speak,’ the Kṣatriya with ‘speak out the truth,’ the Vaiśya by sins pertaining to kine, grain and food, and the Śūdra by all the sins.
‘Whatever regions have been assigned to the slayer of the Brāhmaṇa, to the murderer of women and children, to the betrayer of friends and to the ingrate,—those same shall be thine if thou speakest falsely.’
‘Whatever merit, good man, you may have acquired since your birth, would go to the dogs, if you speak falsely.’
‘You think yourself, blessed man, that “I am alone”; but there ever sits in your heart the silent watcher of virtue and vice.’
‘The, god Yama, the son of Vivasvat, who sits in your heart,—if you have no quarrel with him, you need not visit the Gaṅgā, nor the Kurus.
‘He who gives false evidence shall go for alms, with a potsherd, to the house of his enemy,—naked and shorn, tormented with hunger and thirst, and blind.’
‘Headlong, in blind darkness shall the sinner fall into hell, who, on being interrogated in the course of a judicial investigation, answers the question falsely.
‘He who, having entered the court, bears testimony to what is contrary to facts and what he has not seen, swallows fish along with the bones,—just like a blind man.’
‘The gods do not regard any person in this world as superior to him, whom his knowing soul does not distrust, while he is speaking.’
‘Listen now, gentle friend, in due order, how many relatives, by number, one destroys by giving false evidence, in what cases.’
‘He destroys five by false evidence regarding animals; he destroys ten by false evidence regarding kine; he destroys a hundred by false evidence regarding horses, and a thousand by false evidence regarding men.’
‘Deposing falsely in regard to gold, he kills the born as well as the unborn; by false evidence regarding land, he kills all; never tell a lie regarding land.’
‘That concerning water they declare to be similar to that concerning land; as also that relating to the sexual enjoyment of women, and to gems, water-born as well as granitic.’
‘Having noticed all these evils proceeding prom perjury, speak out directly everything exactly what you have seen and heard.’
‘He shall treat like Śūdras the Brāhmaṇas who tend cattle, who engage in trade, and who are craftsmen, actors, menial servants ok money-lenders.’
In some cases, a man who, though knowing the truth, deposes otherwise, through piety, does not fall off from heaven. This is a divine assertion that they reproduce.
Where the telling of the truth would lead to the death of a Śūdra, a Vaiśva, a Kṣatriya or a Brāhmaṇa,—in that case falsehood should be spoken; as that is preferable to truth.
They should offer sacrifices to Sarasvati with half-boiled rice dedicated to the speech-goddess,—doing the best expiation for the sin of untruthfulness.
Or he shall offer according to rule, clarified butter into the fire, with the ‘kuṣmāṇḍa’-texts or with the verse ‘ut, etc.’ sacred to varuṇa, or with the three verses sacred to the waters.
The man, who, without being ill, does not give evidence for three fortnights, in regard to debts and other matters, should hear that entire debt, as also a penalty of the tenth part in all cases.
That witness,—who may be found, within a week of having given evidence, to suffer from sickness, fire or the death of a relative,—should be made to pay the debt and also the penalty.
In witness-less cases, if he cannot get at the truth between the two disputants by any means, he should discover it by means of oath.
By the great sages, as well as by the Gods, oaths have been taken for the purposes of a case; Vasiṣṭha even swore an oath before the King Paijavana.
The wise man shall not take an oath improperly; taking an improper oath, one becomes ruined here as well as after death.
There is no serious offence in swearing to women, or in connection with marriages, fodder for cows, or fuel, or for the sake of a Brāhmaṇa.
The Brāhmaṇa should be made to swear by truth, the Kṣatriya by conveyances and weapons, the Vaiśya by cattle, grains and gold, and the Śūdra by all sins.
Or, he may make him fetch fire, or make him dive under water, or make him touch the heads of his son and wife severally.
He whom the blazing fire burns not, or whom the water does not throw up, or who does not speedily suffer some misfortune, should be regarded as pure on his oath.
Formerly when Vatsa was accused by his younger brother, fire, the world’s spy, did not burn even a hair of his, because of truth.
In whatever suit false evidence should have been given, the effect of that shall cease, and what has been done shall be undone.
Evidence is called ‘false,’ when it is due to greed, or embarrassment, or fright, or friendship, or lust, or anger, or ignorance, ok childishness.
I am going to explain, in due order, the particular punishments for him who should give false evidence from any one of these causes.
If through greed, he should be fined a thousand; if through embarrassment, the lowest amercement; if through fear, two middlling ones; if through friendship, four times the first.
If through lust, ten times the first; if through anger, three times the next; if through ignorance, full two hundred; and if through childishness, only a hundred.
They declare these penalties for false evidence to have been prescribed by the wise, for the purpose that justice may not fail and injustice hay be prevented.
The king shall however fine and then banish the three castes giving false evidence; but the Brāhmaṇa he shall deprive of his clothes (and dwelling).
Manu Svāyambhuva has named ten places for punishment, where it should be inflicted in the case of the three castes; but the Brāhmaṇa shall depart unscathed.
The genital organ, the stomach, the tongue, the hands, the feet, the eye, the nose, the ears, the property and the body.
Having duly ascertained the motive and the time and place, and having taken into consideration the condition (of the accused) and the nature of the offence,—he shall inflict punishment upon those deserving punishment.
Unjust punishment is destructive of reputation among men and subversive of fame; in the other world also it leads to loss of heaven; he shall therefore avoid it.
The king, punishing those who do not deserve to be punished, and not punishing those who deserve to be punished, attains great ill-fame and goes to hell.
First of all, he shall inflict punishment in the form of reprimand, then in the form of reproach, thirdly in the form of fine, and after that the death-penalty.
When however he is not able to restrain them even by the ‘death-penalty,’—then he should inflict on them all these four.
I am going to describe fully, for the sake of business-transactions, those technical terms that are used in the world in connection with silver and gold.
The small mote that is seen when the sun shines through a lattice-hole they declare to be the ‘triad,’ the very first of measures.
Eight Triads should be known as one ‘Louse-egg’ in measure; three of these as one ‘Black Mustard’; and three of these latter as a ‘White Mustard.’
Six ‘mustards’ make one middling ‘barley-corn’; three of these make one ‘guñjā-berry’; a ‘bean’ is made of five ‘guñja-berries;’ and sixteen ‘beans’ make one ‘gold-piece.’
Four ‘gold-pieces’ make one ‘pala,’ ten palas one ‘dharaṇa’; and two ‘guñja-berries’ of equal weight should be known as one ‘silver-bean.’
Sixteen of these latter make one ‘silver-dharaṇa’ or ‘purāṇa’; and a ‘karṣa’ of copper is to be known as ‘kārṣāpaṇa’ or ‘paṇa.’
Ten ‘dharaṇas’ are to be known as the ‘silver śatamāna’ (centimetre); and the ‘niṣka’ should be understood as four ‘gold-pieces’ in weight.
The first amercement has been declared to be two hundred and fifty paṇas; the middling is to be known as five hundred; and the highest as a thousand.
On the debt being admitted to be due, the debtor deserves (a fine of) five per cent.; and in the case of denial, twice as much; such is the ordinance of manu.
The money-lender shall stipulate an interest sanctioned by Vasiṣṭha, for increasing the capital. He shall take monthly the eightieth part of a hundred.
Or, remembering the duty of the righteous, he may take two in the hundred; by taking two per cent. he does not incur the sin of extortion.
He may charge just two, three, four or five per cent. per month from the four castes respectively.
But when there is profitable pledge, he shall receive no interest on the loan; and there shall be neither transference nor sale of the pledge, merely by the lapse of time.
The pledge shall not be used by force; using it thus, he shall renounce the interest; he shall satisfy the other party with its pr ice; otherwise he would be a stealer of the pledge.
Pledges and Deposits should not suffer much lapse of time; for being left over for a long time, they would be liable to appropriation.
Things used through favour are never forfeited; such as a milch cow, a camel, an ox or the animal that is made over for breaking in.
Whatever thing the owner meekly sees being used by others in his presence, for ten years,—that thing he does not deserve to recover.
If the owner is neither an idiot nor a minor, and the property is used in his own country,—it becomes frustrated in law, and the user becomes entitled to the property.
A pledge, a boundary, minor’s property, a deposit, a property enjoyed by favour, women, king’s property, and the property of a vedic scholar are not lost by adverse possession.
The fool, who, without the owner’s permission, uses a deposit, shall have to remit half the amount of the interest, as compensation for such use.
Interest on money-loans stipulated at one time shall not exceed the double; in the case of grains, fruits, wool and beasts of burden, it shall not go beyond the quintuple.
Interest, stipulated in contravention of the law, being excessive, is not payable. They declare this to be the usurer’s way. It is only five per cent. to which the man is entitled.
One shall not pay or receive an interest beyond the annual, or what is unapproved (or unaccumulated); nor compound interest, nor periodical interest, nor that which is (privately) stipulated, nor corporeal.
He who, unable to repay the debt, wishes to renew the contract, shall change the bond, after paying the accrued interest.
Not having brought forward the gold, he should renew the bond; and he should pay as much interest as may be possible.
When a man has entered into a ‘wheel-contract’ wtth reference to a particular place or time,—if he fails in regard to the place or time, he shall not suffer its reward.
As regards the exact amount to be paid, the interest shall be that which is fixed by persons expert in sea-voyages, and those capable of calculating the profits in connection with a particular place and time.
When a man stands surety for the appearance of a person, if he does not produce him, he shall pay his debt out of his own property.
But the son shall not be liable to pay the surety-money, or a futile gift, or gambling deists, or debts due to liquor, or the balance of fines and duties.
The law laid down in the preceding verse shall apply to the case of ‘Surety for appearance’; in the case of the death of the ‘Surety for payment’ however, the king shall make the heirs also to pay up.
“By what means then would the creditor seek to obtain his dues, in the event of the death of the surety other than that for ‘payment,’ whose character is fully known?”
If the surety were one to whom money had been made over and who had enough money,—then he to whom it had been made over shall pay it out ok his own property; such is the settled rule.
A transaction is not valid when effected by one who is drunk, or insane, or distressed, or wholly dependent, or minor, or senile, or unauthorised
No contract, even though substantiated, is valid, if what is contracted for is contrary to law or to established custom.
Fraudulent mortgages and sales, fraudelent gifts and acceptances, as also all wherein he detects fraud—he shall nullify.
When the borrower is lost, and the expenditure was incurred by the family, the debt is to be paid by the relatives out of their own property, even though these may have been separated.
Should even a servant effect a transaction for the sake of the family,—the master, whether in his own country or abroad, should not repudiate it.
What is given by force, what is ennjoyed by force, what has been caused to be written by force,—all thansactions effected by force Manu has declared to be void.
Three persons suffer for the sake of others: witnesses, surety and the judge: while four persons prosper: the brāhmaṇa, the affluent, the merchant and the king.
Even though reduced (in circumstances), the King shall not take what ought not to be taken; and even though affluent, he shall not relinquish what ought to be taken, be it ever so small.
By the taking of what he ought not to take and by the relinquishing of what he ought to take the king’s weakness becomes proclaimed, and he becomes ruined here as also after death.
By taking what is his due, by the proper adjustment of castes, and by protecting the weak, the power of the king grows, and he prospers here as also after death.
For these reasons, the King shall, like Yama, renounce his likes and dislikes, and behave in the manner of Yama,—his anger suppressed and his senses controlled.
If an evil-minded king, through folly, deal with cases unjustly,—his enemies bring him under their control in no time.
When however, having subdued love and hatred, he deals with cases justly, his subjects turn towards him, as the rivers towards the ocean,
A person who complains to the king against the creditor trying to accomplish his purpose by his own will,—should be made by the king to pay the fourth part, and also the total amount to him
Even by labour shall the debtor make good what is due to the creditor, if he is of the same or of a lower caste; the superior person shall pay it up gradually.
In this manner shall the king settle the disputes of men quarrelling among themselves, deciding them with the help of witnesses and other evidence.
The wise man shall, entrust a deposit to one who is born of good family, is endowed with character, cognisant of the law, and truthful, has a large following, and is wealthy and honourable
In the form in which one shall deposit a thing in the hands of another person, in that same form shall that thing be received back; as the delivery so the recovery.
When requested to restore the deposit, if the trustee do not restore it to the depositor,—then, on the departure of that depositor, in the event of there being no witnesses, the judge shall actually deposit gold (with the trustee) through spies of proper age and appearance, under some pretexts, and then ask him to restore it.—(181-182)
If he admits the deposit exactly in the form and shape in which it was entrusted,—then there is nothing in the charge brought against him by others.
If, however, he should not restore that gold to them in the proper manner, he should be forced to restore both; such is the decree of the law.
Deposits, open and sealed, should never be handed over to the next-of-kin; in the event of a mishap occurring, they become lost; though they do not become lost, if no mishap occurs.
If the man restores it himself to the next-of-kin of the deceased depositor,—he should not be harassed by the king, or by the depositor’s relatives.
In doubtful cases he should try to obtain it without artifice and in a friendly manner; or having ascertained his character, he should settle the matter by gentle means.
In the case of all deposits, such should be the method of restoration; but in the case of a sealed deposit, he should incur nothing, if he does not extract anything from it.
The depositary shall not hake good what has been stolen by thieves, or carried away by water, or burnt,—if he does not extract anything from it.
The appropriator of a deposit, as also one who has not deposited anything (and yet asks for it),—the king shall test by all methods, as also by means of oaths and ordeals prescribed in the scriptures.
He who does not restore a deposit, and he who, without having made any deposit, asks for it,—both of these should be punished like thieves, or be made to pay a fine equal in value.
In all cases the king shall make the appropriator of a deposit pay a fine equal in value to it; also the appropriator of a friendly loan.
The man who may appropriate, by fraudulent means, the property of another person, should be punished publicly, along with his accomplices, with various modes of death.
As much of a certain deposit has been entrusted in the presence of a number of men—so much should it be decided to be; the party misrepresenting it becomes liable to punishment.
When a trust has been created privately and accepted also privately, then it should be restored also secretly: as the delivery so the restoration.
Thus shall the king come to a decision regarding property given as ‘deposit’ and that which is given as ‘friendly loan,’—without causing any injury to the keeper of the deposit.
Thus shall the king come to a decision regarding property given as ‘deposit’ and that which is given as ‘friendly loan,’—without causing any injury to the keeper of the deposit.
If a man sells another man’s property, without being its owner, and without the owner’s consent, the judge shall not admit him as a witness,—he being a thief; though he may not be regarded as a thief.
If a relative, he shall be made to pay the penalty of six hundred; if he is not a relative, nor one having access to him, he shall incur the guilt of theft (specially).
If a gift or sale is made by one who is not the owner, it should be held to be as not-made,—such being the rule of judicial proceedings.
Where possession is evident, but no sort of title is perceptible, there title, and not possession, shall be the proof; such is the settled rule.
If a man obtains a property from the market, in the presence of witnesses, he acquires that property with a clear title obtained by legal purchase.
If the source cannot be traced, the person (buyer), whose conduct has been cleared by the fact of the sale being public, is let off without punishment, but the man who lost the property shall receive it back.
Any commodity that is mixed up with another should not be sold; nor what is without substance, nor what is deficient, nor what is at a distance, nor what is concealed.
After one damsel has been shown, if another be given to the bridegroom, then he should marry both of them for the same single price,—so Manu has ordained.
The giver, of a girl who is insane or leprous or has suffered copulation, does not deserve punishment, if he has previously declared her defects.
If a priest appointed at a sacrifice abandons his work, his associates shall pay him only such share as may be in keeping with the work actually done by him.
He who abandons his work after the fees have been paid, should receive his full share; and the work should be got done by another.
In connection with a rite, when specific fees are prescribed for its several parts,—will one man take all these, or shall they all share them?
At Fire-laying, the Adhvaryu shall take the chariot, and the Brahman the horse; or the Hotṛ shall take the house: and the Udgātṛ shall take the cart at the Soma-purchase.
From among all, the chief men shall receive half; the next shall receive half of that; the ‘thirders’ the third part and the ‘fourthers’ the fourth part of it.
Among men carrying on their business jointly, the allotment of shares should be done by the application of these principles.
When a man gives money, for a pious purpose, to another who asks for it,—if, subsequently, it is not used for that purpose, then, it shall not be given to him.
If, through arrogance or greed, the man should seek to recover it, he should be made by the King to pay one gold-piece, as an expiation for that theft.
Thus has been fully explained the lawful non-misappropriation of gifts; after this I am going to describe the ‘non-misappropriation of Wages.’
If a hireling, without being ill, does not perform the stipulated work, through arrogance,—he should be fined eight ‘Kṛṣṇalas,’ and should not receive his wages.
But if he is ill and on recovering, completes the work as originally stipulated, he shall receive his wages for it, even after a long time.
When a man, sick or well, does not get the stipulated work done, he shall not receive hi s wages,—even though the work be only slightly incomplete.
Thus has the entire law bearing upon the action of ‘Non-payment of Wages’ been explained. After this I am going to expound the law relating to Contract-breakers.
If a man, after having entered into a compact under oath with a village, a country or a confederation, should break it, through greed,—him the king shall banish from his kingdom.
Having caught such a breaker of compact, he shall make him pay six ‘niṣkas’ of four ‘suvarṇas’ each, and also one silver ‘śatamāna.’
This is the law of punishment which the king shall follow in the case of the breakers of compacts relating to villages and caste-federations.
If, after having bought or sold anything, one should repent of it, he may return or take back that thing within ten days.
But after ten days, he shall neither return nor take it back; he who takes it back, as well as he who returns it, should be fined by the king six hundred.
If a man gives a defective damsel, without mentioning the defects, he should be punished by the king himself with a fine of ninety-six ‘paṇas.’
If a man, through malice, speaks of a maiden as ‘not a virgin’ he should receive the punishment of one hundred, if unable to prove her impurity.
The marriage-ritual texts are applicable to virgins only, and nowhere among men, to non-virgins; and this because these latter are excluded from religious acts.
The marriage -texts are clearly conducive to ‘wife-hood’; and these are to be recognised by the learned as completed at the ‘seventh-step.’
Whenever any person should have repentance in regard to any compact that has been entered into—the king shall bring him to the righteous path, in the manner just described.
I am going to expound fully the true law relating to disputes between owners and keepers arising from transgressions regarding cattle.
Responsibility for the safe keeping during the day rests with the keeper, and during the night, with the owner, ip in his own house; if otherwise, the keeper should be responsible.
If the hired cattle-keeper is one paid with milk, he shall, with the owner’s permission, milk the best out of ten; this shall be the ‘wages’ of the keeper, if he receives no other wages.
The keeper alone should make good what has strayed, or been destroyed by worms, or killed by dogs, or has perished in an unsafe place,—if it was left without human aid.
But the keeper shall not have to make good what has been taken away by thieves openly,—if he informs his own master of it at the proper place and time.
On the death of the animals, he shall make over to the owner their ears, skin, tail-hairs, bladder and tendons and the concrete bile, and also point out their marks.
When goats and sheep have been surrounded by wolves, and the keeper does not come for ward,—if the wolf forcibly kill any, the blame shall lie with the keeper.
When however, they are grazing together in the forest, duly protected,—if a wolf pounces upon one and kills it,—the keeper is not to blame.
Around the village there should be a pasture-ground, four hundred ‘bows’ or three ‘stick-throws’ (in width); but three times that space around the town.
If the cattle damage the unfenced crops therein, the king, in that case, shall not inflict punishment on the cattle-keepers.
One should set up an enclosure there which the camel cannot see, and shut up every opening through which the head of a dog ok a boar could be thrust.
If cattle attended by the keeper be found in an enclosed field, on the road-side or near the village, the keeper should be fined a hundred; but cattle without a keeper shall be driven off.
In the case of other fields, the cattle-keeper should be fined a ‘paṇa’ and a quarter; and in all cases the crop shall be made good to the owner of the field; such is the established rule.
But Manu has declared that no punishment shall be inflicted upon a cow within ten days of its calving, or bulls or dedicated cattle,—whether with or without keepers.
When there is transgression on the part of the farmer himself, his fine shall be ten times the royal share,—half of that in the case of servants, if it is unknown to the farmer.
This is the rule that the righteous king shall observe, in the case of transgressions by owners, by cattle and by the keepers.
When a dispute regarding boundaries arises between two villages, the king shall settle the boundary during the month of Jyeṣṭha, when the landmarks are distinctly perceptible.
He shall plant boundary-trees,—such as the Nyagrodha, the Aśvattha, the Kiṃśuka, the Śālmalī, the Sāla and the Tāla,—as also plants with milky juice.
Also thickets, bamboos of various kinds, the Śamī-tree, creepers and mounds, reeds and Kubjaka thickets; trees shall not be obliterated.
Tanks, water-reservoirs, ponds and fountains should be built on boundary-links; as also temples.
He shall also set up hidden boundary-marks,—seeing that in the world there are constant trespasses, due to the ignorance of boundaries among men.
As also, stones, bones, cow’s hair, chaff, ashes, potsherds, dry cow dung, bricks, cinders, pebbles, and sand.
Other such-like things which the earth may not eat up in time,—these he shall secretly set up on junctions of boundaries.
By these signs shall the king determine the boundary between two contending parties; as also by long-continued possession and by flowing streams of water.
If, even on the inspection of the marks, there should be a doubt, the settlement of the dispute regarding boundaries shall be entirely dependent upon witnesses.
Witnesses regarding boundaries shall be questioned in regard to the boundary-marks, in the presence of an assembly of villagers and also of the two contending parties.
The opinion that, on being questioned, they unanimously declare in regard to the boundary,—according to that he shall lay down the boundary, recording also the names of them all.
Placing earth upon their heads, wearing garlands and red clothes, and being sworn by their respective meritorious deeds, they shall decide honestly.
If they decide in the right manner, they, being truthful witnesses, become purified; but if they decide contrariwise, they should be made to pay a fine of two hundred.
In the absence of witnesses four honest inhabitants of neighbouring villages shall make the determination of the boundary, in the presence of the king.
In the absence of such original inhabitants of neighbouring villages as could be witnesses in regard to the boundary, the king may examine these (following) frequenters of forests also.
Hunters, Fowlers, Cowherds, Fishermen, Root-diggers, Snake-catchers, Gleaners and other Foresters.
As they, on being questioned in fairness, declare the marks of boundary-lines between two villages, even so shall the king fix it.
In the case of fields, walls, tanks, gardens and houses, the decision regarding boundary-marks is dependent upon the neighbours.
In the case of men disputing about boundary-marks, if the neighbours depose falsely, all of them should be severally punished by the king with the ‘middle amercement.’
If a person, by intimidation, appropriates a house, a tank, a garden, or a field, he shall be fined five hundred; but only two hundred, if he does it in ignorance.
In the event of the boundary being unascertainable, the righteous king shall himself assign to them their lands, on the basis of advantages. Such is the established law.
Thus has the whole law relating to the demarcation of boundaries been propounded. After this I am going to expound that relating to verbal assault.
On abusing a Brāhmaṇa the Kṣatriya should be fined one hundred; and the Vaiśya one hundred and fifty; or two hundred; the Śūdra however deserves immolation.
For abusing a Kṣatriya, the Brāhmaṇa should be fined fifty; and in the case of a Vaiśya, the fine shall be twenty-five; and in that of a Shudra, twelve.
Among twice-born men, when there is offence against an equal, the fine is twelve only in the case of unutterable abuses, it shall be double.
If a once-born person insults a twice-born one with gross abuse, he should suffer the cutting off of his tongue; as he is of low origin.
If he mentions the name and caste of these men with scorn, a burning iron nail ten inches long shall be thrust into his mouth.
If through arrogance, he teaches brāhmaṇas their duty, the king shall pour heated oil into his mouth and ears.
He who, through arrogance, speaks falsely regarding the learning, the habitat, the caste, the occupation, or the bodily details (of another person), should be made to pay a pine of two hundred.
If a man, even truly, calls another ‘one-eyed’ or ‘lame’ or something else like it,—he should be made to pay a fine of at least one ‘Kārṣāpaṇa.’
He who alienates the mother, the father, the wife, the brother, the child or the preceptor, should be made to pay a hundred; as also one who does not give the way to his preceptor.
The discerning king shall inflict this punishment upon the Brāhmaṇa and the Kṣatriya: the brāhmaṇa shall be fined the lowest amercement and the kṣatriya the middlemost
On the Vaiśya and the Śūdra also, the inflicting of punishment shall be of the same kind, according to their respective castes,—barring mutilation; such is the decision.
Thus the law relating to punishments in connection with verbal assaults been truly expounded; after thisI am going to profound the law relating to physical assault.
With whatever limb the low-born man hurts a superior person, every such limb of his shall be cut off; this is the teaching of Manu.
If he raises his hand or a stick, he should have his hand cut off; if he strikes in anger with the foot, his foot shall be cut off.
If a low-born person tries to occupy the same seat with his superior, he should be branded on the hip and banished; or the king shall have his buttocks cut off.
If, out of arrogance, he spits, the king should have his two lips cut off; if he urinates, then his penis; and if he breaks wind, his anus.
If he catches hold of the hair, the king shall unhesitatingly have his hands out off; also if he lays hold of the feet, the beard, the neck, or the scrotum.
If he catches hold of the hair, the king shall unhesitatingly have his hands out off; also if he lays hold of the feet, the beard, the neck, or the scrotum.
One who bruises the skin should be fined one hundred; as also one who fetches blood; he who cuts the flesh, six ‘niṣkas’ and the bone-breaker should be banished.
In the case of all trees, as their usefulness so should be the punishment inflicted for injuring them; this is the settled rule.
When a hurt has been inflicted on men or animals, with the motive of causing pain, the king shall inflict punishment in proportion to the greatness of the pain caused.
In the case of injury to limbs, as also of strength and of blood,—the man should be made to pay the expenses of recovery, or the whole amount as ‘fine.’
When a man, either intentionally or unintentionally, damages the goods of another, he shall give satisfaction to him and pay to the king a fine equal to it.
In the case or leather and leathern vessels, and in that of those made of wood or clay, the fine shall be five times their value; as also in the case of flowers, roots and fruits.
In the case of the conveyance, its rider and its owner, they lay down ten exclusions; for the rest penalties are prescribed.
When there is snapping of the nose-string, when the yoke is broken, when it turns sideways or backwards, when the axle breaks, and when the wheel is broken; when the fittings or the yoking strap or the bridle are torn, and when there has been the loud cry ‘get out of the way,’—there is no punishment; so has Manu declared
When however, on account of the driver’s ineptitude, the cart turns off and causes injury, the owner shall be punished with a fine of two hundred. If the driver is a trained one, it is he that should be punished; if the driver is untrained, all the occupants of the cart should be fined a hundred each.
But if he happens to be stopped on the road and causes the death of a living being, either through animals or through the cart,—in such a case there is no doubt regarding punishment.
If the case of a man being killed, on the spot, the guilt would be similar to that of the thief; and half of that in the case of the larger animals, such as cows, elephants, camels, horses and the like.
In the case of hurting petty animals, the fine is two h undred; and fifty in the case of the auspicious quadrupeds and birds.
In the case of donkeys, goat and sheep the fine shall consist of five ‘māṣas’; and the fine shall be one ‘māṣa’ for the killing of a dog ok a pig.
The wife, the son, the slave, the servant and the uterine brother shall be beaten with a rope or a split bamboo, when they have committed a fault.
But only on the back part of the body, and never on the upper part; he who strikes otherwise than this incurs the guilt of a thief.
Thus has the law relating to physical assault been fully explained; after this I am going to expound the law for the regulating of punishments in cases of theft.
The King shall, make the best efforts for suppressing thieves; by the suppression of thieves comes fame and the kingdom prospers.
The King who imparts security is ever to be honoured; his sacrificial session constantly prospers, accompanied as it is by the gift of ‘security.’
To the King who protects (his people) accrues the sixth part of the spiritual merit of all persons; and the sixth of their demerit also accrues to him, if he protects them not
When one reads the Veda, when one performs a sacrifice, when one makes gifts, when one worships,—to the sixth part of each of those the king becomes entitled, in consequence of properly protecting the people
The king who, according to the law, protects all creatures and strikes them who deserve to be struck, offers, day by day, sacrifices at which hundreds of thousands are given away.
The king, who, without affording protection, takes tributes, taxes, duties, presents and fines, would immediately sink into hell.
He who affords no protection and devours the people, grabbing his tribute of the sixth part of the produce,—him they declare to be the imbiber of the filth of the whole people.
He who heeds not the bounds of morality, who is a disbeliever, who is extortionate, who does not afford protection, and is grabbing,—such a king one should regard as doomed to perdition.
He shall carefully suppress the unrighteous by three modes (of restraint)—by imprisonment, by enchaining and by various forms of ‘immolation.’
For by suppressing the vicious and postering the virtuous, kings become purified, just as twice-born men by the daily sacrifices.
The king should always forgive the partisans of litigants who abuse him, as also the young, the aged and the infirm,—thereby accomplishing his own welfare.
He who, on being abused by men in distress, forgives, becomes exalted to heaven, by that act; while he who, through kingly pride, does not forgive, goes, by that act, to hell.
The wise thief shall approach the king, with flying hair, confessing the theft, with the words—‘I have done this, punish me’;
—Carrying on his shoulder a pestle, or a Club of khadira wood, or a spear sharp at both ends, or an iron staff.
The thief becomes absolved from the theft, either through punishment or through acquittal. By not punishing the thief, the king imbibes the guilt of the thief.
The Embryo-killer expurgates his guilt on him who eats his food, the misbehaving wife on her husband, the disciple and the sacrificer on the preceptor, and the thief on the king.
Men who, having committed crimes, have been punished by Kings, become freed from guilt and go to heaven, just like well-behaved good men.
When one steals the rope or the water-pot from the well, or damages a water-drinking establishment, he should be punished with a fine of one ‘māṣa,’ and should restore the article to the place.
There shall be ‘immolation’ for one who steals more than ten jars of grain; in other cases he should he made to pay eleven times as much, as also make good the property to the owner.
In the case or articles weighed by scales,—gold, silver and the rest,—if more than a hundred (are stolen),
In the case of more than fifty, the cutting off of the hands is prescribed. In other cases, the king shall inflict a fine of eleven times the value.
For stealing noble men, and specially women, and the precious gems, the thief deserves ‘immolation.’
For the stealing of large animals, of weapons or medicines, the king shall determine the punishment, after considering the time and the purpose.
For stealing cows belonging to a Brāhmaṇa, and for piercing them with the goad, and for stealing animals, the thief should be immediately made half-footed.
In the case of the theft of yarns, cotton, fermenting drug, cowdung, molasses, curds, milk, skimmed curd, water and grass ,—of vessels made of bamboo or cane, as also of salts, earthenware, earth and ashes —of fish, birds, oil, clarified butter, meat, honey, and other animal-products —of other things of this kind, spirituous liquors, cooked rice and all kinds of cooked food,—the fine shall be double the value of the thing (stolen).—(326-329)
For flowers, green corns, shrubs, creepers, trees and other unhusked (grains), the fine shall consist of five ‘kṛṣṇalas.’
For husked grains, for vegetables, roots and fruits, there shall be a fine of a hundred, in a case where there has been no propitiation; and fifty, where there has been propitiation.
If the act is committed with violence and in the presence of men, it is ‘robbery’; it is ‘theft’ when done in the absence of men, and when it is denied after having been done.
If a man steals these things when they have been prepared, the king should fine him one hundred; as also him who steals the fire from the house.
By whatever limb the thief operates against men, that shall the king take off, by way of retribution.
Neither the father or the preceptor or the friend or the mother or the wife or the son or the priest is unpunishable for the King, when they do not keep within their duty.
When an ordinary man would be fined one ‘Kārṣāpaṇa,’ the king should be fined one thousand; such is the established rule.
In the case of theft, the guilt of a Śūdra is eightfold, that of the Vaiśya sixteen-fold, and that of the Kṣatriya thirty-two-fold; that of the Brāhmaṇa sixty-four-fold, or fully hundred-fold, or twice sixty-four-fold; when he is cognisant of the good or bad quality of the act.
Fuel for fire and trees, roots and fruits, and grass, for feeding cows,—the taking of these Manu has declared to be no theft.
If a Brāhmaṇa seeks, even by sacrificing and teaching, to obtain wealth from one who has taken what has not been given to him,—he is just like a thief.
If a twice-born person, running short of provisions while on a journey, takes two sugar-cane stalks, or two roots, from another man’s field, he does not deserve to be made to pay a fine.
One who enchains the unchained, or sets free the enchained, as also one who takes away a slave, a horse or a chariot, incurs the guilt of the thief.
By punishing thieves in accordance with th is law, the king obtains fame in this world, and after death, unsurpassable bliss.
The king who is desirous of indra’s eternal place, as also of imperishable fame, shall not ignore the desperado even for a moment.
He who commits violence is to be regarded as the worst offender, as compared to one who is wicked of speech, to a thief and to one who hurts with a staff.
The king who condones the perpetrator of violence quickly falls into destruction and incurs hatred.
Neither for the sake of friendship, nor for the sake of a large gain of money, should the king let off the perpetrators of violence, who cause terror to all living beings.
Twice-born persons shall carry arms: When religion is interfered with, when there is confusion among the twice-born castes caused by the exigencies of time, in his own defence, in cases of hindrance of sacrificial fees, in the case of outrages upon Brāhmaṇas and women,—if one strikes in the cause of right, he incurs no sin.
Without hesitation one should strike an approaching desperado,—be he a preceptor, a child, or an aged man, or a highly learned Brāhmaṇa.
No evil of any kind accrues to the slayer for killing a desperado, either openly or secretly; as it is only Fury recoiling upon Fury.
Those men who are addicted to intercourse with the wives of other men, the king shall banish after having branded them with terror-inspiring punishments.
For out of that arises the admixture of castes among people;—whence follows root-rending unrighteousness, tending to total destruction.
A man who engages in secret conversation with the wife of another person,—if he is one who has been previously accused of similar offences,—should receive the penalty of the ‘first amercement.’
If, however, he is one who has not been previously accused, and converses with her for some good reason, he does not incur any guilt; as in his case there has been no transgression.
He who converses with ‘another’s woman’ at a watering place, or in a wilderness, or in a forest, or at the confluence of rivers,—incurs the guilt of ‘adultery.’
Offering help, flirting, touching of ornaments and clothes, sitting on the same bed,—all this has been declared to be ‘adultery.’
If one touches a woman in an improper place, or condones it when touched by her,—all this, when done with mutual consent, has been declared to be ‘adultery’
In a case of adultery, a non-Brāhmaṇa deserves the penalty ending in death; as the wives of all the four castes are always the most deserving of protection.
Mendicants, bards, persons initiated for a rite and craftsmen may converse with women, unchecked.
One should not converse with the wives of other men, when forbidden. If, on being forbidden, he does converse, he becomes liable to be fined one ‘suvarṇa.’
This rule does not apply to the case of the wives of dancers and singers, or of those who make a living of themselves; for these men secretly bring their women into contact (with other men), and tempt them on.
Yet he who secretly carries on conversation with these women, or with maidservants devoted to one master, or with female ascetics, should be made to pay something.
If a man of equal status violates an unwilling maiden, he deserves immediate death; but if he violates a willing one, he shall not suffer death.
If a maiden approaches a superior person, she shall not be made to pay anything; if however she courts an inferior person, she shall be kept confined in the house.
An inferior man courting a superior maiden deserves death; he who courts a maiden of equal status, shall pay the nuptial fee, if her father so wishes.
But if any man wantonly defiles a maiden through sheer audacity, his fingers should be instantly clipped off, or he should be fined six hundred.
A man of equal status defiling a willing maiden shall not suffer amputation of fingers; he should be made to pay the fine of two hundred with a view to prevent repetition.
If a maiden pollutes another maiden, her fine shall be two hundred; she shall also pay the double of her nuptial fee and shall receive ten lashes.
But if a woman pollutes a maiden, she deserves immediate shaving off, or the amputation of two fingers, and also being carried by a donkey.
If a woman, proud of relations and her qualities, passes over her husband, the king shall have her devoured by dogs in a place frequented by many.
The offending male he should make to lie down upon a redhot iron bed; they shall put wooden-logs over him, so that the sinner may be burnt.
If the convicted man is accused again within a year, he shall be punished with a double fine. the same also in the case of intercourse with a ‘vrātyā’ or a ‘chāṇḍālī.’
A śūdra having intercourse with a twice-born woman, protected or unprotected, shall be deprived of his limb and his whole property, in the case of the unprotected woman, and of everything in that of the protected.
The Vaiśya should be fined his entire property after a year’s imprisonment; the Kṣatriya is to be fined one thousand, and be shaved with urine.
If the Vaiśya and the Kṣatriya have intercourse with an unprotected Brāhmaṇa woman, the Vaiśya should be committed with five hundred and the Kṣatriya with one thousand.
But both these, when offending against a protected Brāhmaṇa woman, should be punished like a Śūdra, or burnt in a fire of dry grass.
The Brāhmaṇa who has intercourse with a protected Brāhmaṇa woman by force should be fined one thousand; he who has connection with a willing one, should be fined five hundred.
Tonsure has been prescribed as the death-penalty for the Brāhmaṇa; for other castes the penalty would be actual death.
Verily he shall not kill the Brāhmaṇa, even though he be steeped in all crimes; he should banish him from the kingdom, with all his property and unhurt.
There is no greater crime on earth than the slaying of a Brāhmaṇa; the king shall, therefore, not even think of his death in his mind.
If a Vaiśya approaches a protected Kṣatriya woman, or the Kṣatriya a Vaiśya woman,—both these deserve the same punishment as that in the case of an unprotected Brāhmaṇa woman.
The Brāhmaṇa having intercourse with the said two, when protected, should be made to pay a fine of one thousand; the fine for the Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya approaching a Śūdra woman, should be one thousand.
In the case of the Vaiśya approaching an unprotected Kṣatriya woman, the fine shall be five hundred; but the Kṣatriya may suffer tonsure or the fine.
The Brāhmaṇa, approaching an unprotected Vaiśya or Kṣatriya woman, should be fined five hundred, and one thousand for approaching a woman of the lowest order.
That king in whose town there is no thief, no adulterer, no defamer, no criminal, no assaulter,—attains the regions of Indra.
The suppression of these five in his own dominions secures to the king paramount sovereignty among his peers and fame in the world.
If a sacrificer forsakes an officiating priest, and if an officiating priest forsakes a sacrificer,—each being capable of doing the work and free from disqualifications,—their punishment is one hundred each
Neither the mother, nor the father, nor the wife, nor the son deserve to be forsaken; he who forsakes these, unless they are outcasts, should be fined six hundred by the king.
For twice-born men disputing among themselves regarding any point relating to the orders, the king, desirous of his own welfare, shall not determine the law.
Having, with the assistance of Brāhmaṇas, received them with due honour, the king shall, at first, pacify them with soothing words, and then explain to them their duty.
If, at a festival where twenty twice-born men are invited, a Brāhmaṇa does not entertain his frontal and back neighbours, who are quite worthy,—he deserves to be fined one ‘māṣa.’
The Vedic scholar who does not entertain a worthy Vedic scholar at such auspicious rites, should be made to pay twice the quantity of that meal, and also a ‘māṣa’ of gold.
A blind man, an idiot, a cripple, an old man of seventy, and one who attends upon Vedic scholars should not be made to pay any taxes by any one.
The king should always respect the Vedic scholar, the sick and the distressed, the infant and the aged, the indigent, the man of high family and the gentleman.
The washerman shall wash (clothes) gently on a smooth board of cotton-tree wood; he shall not carry clothes in other clothes; nor shall he allow them to be worn.
The weaver shall repay ten ‘palas’ with one ‘pala’ added to it; if he acts otherwise than this, he should be made to pay a fine of twelve.
The king shall take one-twentieth of the price of saleable commodities, that may be fixed by men who have experience of custom-houses and are experts in all kinds of merchandise.
Those commodities that have been proclaimed as the ‘king’s monopoly,’ and those that are forbidden,—if any one, through greed, exports these, the king shall confiscate all his property.
If one who buts and sells avoids a custom-house, and at the improper time, or makes a wrong statement in counting,—he shall be made to pay a fine eight times the amount evaded.
The king shall regulate the purchase and sale of all marketable commodities after having taken into consideration their source, destination and detention, as also profit and loss.
After the lapse of every five days, or after that of every fortnight, the king shall publicly fix the prices of things.
Scales, weights and measures should be duly marked; and they should be re-examined after every six months.
At a ferry-crossing, a cart shall be made to pay one ‘paṇa’; one man’s burden half a ‘paṇa,’ an animal and a woman a quarter ‘paṇa,’ and an unloaded man one half of a quarter.
Carts laden with commodities should be made to pay the ferry-toll according to their value; those not laden with commodities may pay a triple, as also men without luggage.
For a long passage, the boat-fare should be in propor tion to the time and place; this should be understood to be the rule regarding the banks of rivers; in connection with the sea, there is no fixed rule.
But a woman who is pregnant two months or more, an ascetic, a hermit, and brāhmaṇas in holy orders shall not be made to pay the toll at a ferry-crossing.
If anything on the boat happen to be damaged by the fault of the boatmen,—it shall be made good by the boatmen collectively, each according to his share.
This law has been laid down in connection with suits by boat-passengers relating to the negligence of boatmen in water; there is no punishment in the case of accidents due to heaven.
He shall make the Vaiśya to carry on trade, money-lending, agriculture,—and cattle-trading; and the Śūdra to perform service for the twice-born castes.
A Brāhmaṇa shall, through compassion, support a Vaiśya and a Kṣatriya, who are distressed for a livelihood, and should make them do his own work.
If the Brāhmaṇa, through the sense of mastery, and out of greed, makes sanctified twice-born persons do fertile work, against their will,—he should be fined by the king six hundred.
But a Śūdra, whether bought or unbought, he shall make to do servile work; since it is for doing servile work for the Brāhmaṇa that he has been created by the self-born one.
Even though set free by the master, the Śūdra is not released from service; since that is innate in him, and who can release him from it?
There are seven kinds of slaves captured under a banner, slave on food, born in the house, bought, presented, hereditary, and slave by punishment.
The wive, the son and the slave,—these three are declared to have no property; whatever they acquire is the property of him to whom they belong.
The Brāhmaṇa may confidently have recourse to seizing the goods of the Śūdra; as the latter has no property, and his property is meant to be seized by the master.
The king shall make the Vaiśya and the Shudra carefully to perform their duties; for by swerving from their duties they would disturb this world.
Day after day he shall look after his business-centres, his conveyances, his income and expenditure regularly, and mines and treasury.
The king who completes all this business, removes all sin and attains the highest state.
I shall now expound the eternal duties of the man and woman, who keep to the righteous path, during union and separation.
During the day and the night women should not be left to themselves by their men. If they become addicted to sensual objects, they should be kept under one’s control.
The father guards her during virginity, the husband guards her in youth, the sons guard her in old age; the woman is never fit for independence.—(iii).
Censurable is the father who gives her not away at the right time; censurable the husband who approaches her not; and censurable the son who, on the death of her husband, does not take care of her
Women should be specially guarded against even small attachments; for, if not guarded, they would bring grief to both families.
Looking upon this as the highest duty of all castes, even weak husbands strive to guard their wives
He who carefully protects his wipe preserves his offspring, his character, his family, his own self, and also his religion.
The husband, entering the womb of his wife, becomes the embryo and is then born; the wife-hood of the ‘wife’ consists in this that the husband is re-born of her.
As the man to whom the woman clings, so the offspring that she brings forth; hence for the sake of the purity of the offspring one should carefully guard the woman.
No man can guard women forcibly; they can however be guarded by the employment of these expedients.
He shall employ her in the accumulation and disbursement of wealth, as also in cleanliness, in religious acts, in the cooking of food and in taking care of the household furniture.
Women confined in the house under trusted servants are not well guarded; really well guarded are those who guard themselves by themselves.
Drinking, associating with wicked people, separation from her husband, rambling, sleeping and residence at other’s house are the six corrupters of women.
They care not for beauty; they have no regard for age; be he handsome or ugly, they enjoy the man simply because he is a male.
Even though carefully guarded, they injure their husbands, on account of their passion for males, of ficklemindedness and of innate want of tenderness.
Knowing this disposition to be innate in them, from the very creation of the lord, the man should make the highest effort to guard them.
Manu assigned to women sleep, sitting, ornament, lust, anger, dishonesty, malice and bad conduct.
For women there is no dealing with the sacred texts; such is the rule of law; the fact is that, being destitute of organs and devoid of sacred texts, women are ‘false’
So also there are many texts sung in the vedas with a view to indicate the true character of women. from among these listen to those texts that are meant to be expiatory.
‘If my mother, unfaithful unto her lord, became enamoured while roaming about,—may my father’s semen remove that from me’;—this is an example of this.
What is said here is the proper expiation for whatever ill she thinks in her mind of her husband.
When a woman is united in one form with a man possessed of certain qualities, she becomes herself endowed with similar qualities,—like a river united with the ocean.
The low-born Akṣamālā united with Vaśiṣṭha , and the doe united with Mandapālū , became worthy of worship.
These as well as other women, of low birth, have attained eminence in the world, through the good qualities of their respective husbands.
Thus has been declared the common practice, as between husband and wife, which is always happy; now understand the laws relating to children, which are conducive to happiness here as well as after death.
There is no difference whatever between the goddess of fortune and the women who secure many blessings for the sake of bearing children, who are worthy of worship and who form the glory of their household
The begetting of the child, the nourishing of the born, and the ordinary life of the world,—of each of these things the woman is clearly the main-spring.
Off-spring, religious acts, faithful service, highest happiness,—all this is dependent on the wife; as also the attainment of heaven by oneself as well as by his forefathers.
These are the same as verses 164 and 165 of Discourse V
Listen to the following disquisition regarding the son, propitious and salutary to the world, set forth by the wise patriarchs and the great sages.
They recognise the son to be the husband’s; but in regard to one who is only the progenitor, there is diversity of opinion; some people declare the begetter, while others the owner of the soil (to be the owner of the child).
The woman has been declared to be like the ‘soil,’ and the man has been declared to be like the seed; and the production of all corporeal beings proceeds from the union of the soil and the seed.
In some cases the seed is prominent; but in others it is the female womb; when both are equal, the offspring is highly commended.
Prima-facie argument —“As between the seed and the womb, the seed is declared to be superior; because the production of all things is marked by the characteristics of the seed.”
“As is the seed which is sown in the soil prepared in season, so does the seed spring forth, marked by its own qualities.”
“This earth is called the primeval womb of things; and yet, in its development, the seed does not develop any qualities of the womb.”
“In this world, seeds sown in season by the cultivators even in one and the same plot of land spring-forth in various forms, according to their nature”.
“ Vrīhi -corn, rice, mudga-beans, sesamum, māṣa-beans , barley, leeks and sugar-cane are produced in accordance with the seeds.”
“It is not possible that what is sown is of one kind and what is produced is of a different kind; the seed that is produced is the same that is sown.”
The established conclusion —for this reason he who is intelligent, well-trained, and conversant with the sciences and the arts, should never, if he desires longevity, sow in another’s wife.
On this point, persons conversant with ancient lore recite some ‘ Gāthās ’ sung by Vāyu , to the effect that man should not sow his seed in what belongs to another.
‘As the arrow shot by an after-shooter hitting a wounded animal in a hole (already made) is wasted, so does the seed become wasted when sown in what belongs to another.’
People learned in ancient lore have regarded this Pṛthvī (earth) to be the wife of Pṛthu ; they declare the field to belong to him who has cleared off the stalks, and the deer to him who struck the dart.
The man is a man only in so far as he consists of himself, his wife and his progeny. thus it is that the Brāhmaṇas have declared that ‘the husband is declared to be the same as the wife.’
Either by sale or by repudiation the wife is not released from her husband; such is the law that we know, as originally propounded by prajapati.
Once does the share fall to a man; once is a maiden given away; once does one say ‘I give’; each of these three comes only once.
As with cows, mares, she-camels, slave-girls, buffaloes, she-goats and ewes, it is not the begetter who obtains the offspring,—even thus it is with the wives of others
If persons, possessing no fields, but having seeds, sow these in fields belonging to others,—they never obtain the grain of the crop that is produced.
If a bull were to beget a hundred calves on others’ cows, those calves would belong to the owners of the cows, and the bull’s emissions would be in vain.
Similarly persons who have no ‘soil’ of their own—if they sow in the ‘soil’ belonging to another man, they confer benefit upon the owner of the ‘soil,’ and the owner of the seed reaps no fruit.
If between the owner of the soil and the owner of the seed, there has been no compact regarding the produce, then the chops belong clearly to the owner of the soil;—the receptacle being more important than the seed.
If however the seed is given for the purpose of sowing, after the acceptance of a compact,—in that case both, the owner of the soil and the owner of the seed, are considered to be sharers of the produce.—(r>3)
If seed, carried away by rain or wind, germinates in a soil,—that seed belongs to the owner of the soil, and the owner of the seed does not receive the produce.
This same law should be understood as applying to the offspring of cows, mares, slave-girls, she-camels, she-goats and ewes; as also of birds and buffaloes.
Thus has been explained to you the comparative importance and non-importance of the seed and the womb; after this i am going to expound the duties of women during times of distress.
The wife of the elder brother is, for the younger, a ‘wife of the preceptor’; and the wife of the younger brother has been declared to be a ‘daughter-in-law’ for the elder.
If the elder brother has recourse to the wife of the younger, or the younger brother to the wife of the elder, they become outcasts, even though ‘authorised,’—except in times of distress.
On failure of issue, the woman, on being authorised, may obtain, in the proper manner, the desired offspring, either from her younger brother-in-law or from a ‘ Sapiṇḍa ’.
He who has been authorised in regard to a widow shall, annointed with clarified butter and with speech controlled, beget, at night, one son,—and on no account a second one.
Some people, learned in the subject, admit, on the basis of propriety, of a second procreation on women,—perceiving, as they do, that the couple’s purpose of authorisation’ is not (otherwise) accomplished.
But when the purpose of the ‘authorisation’ in regard to the widow has been duly accomplished, the two should behave towards each other like an elder and like a daughter-in-law.
If the two persons thus ‘authorised’ renounce the law and act from carnal desire, both would become outcasts,—being like one who has intercourse with his daughter-in-law and one who defiles the bed of his elder.
By twice-born persons the widow shall not be ‘authorised’ in regard to another person; by ‘authorising’ her in regard to another, they would violate the eternal law.
Nowhere in the mantra-texts bearing upon marriage is ‘authorisation’ mentioned; nor again is the marriage of the widow mentioned in the injunction of marriage.
During the time that King Vena was ruling over his kingdom, this reprehensible bestial practice was introduced by ignorant twice-born men among men also.
In ancient times that chief of royal sages, possessing the whole world, brought about the confusion of castes, having his mind beset with lust.
Since then, whenever any one, through folly, ‘authorises’ a woman whose husband is dead, to beget children,—him the good men censure.
If the husband of a maiden dies after the troth has been verbally plighted,—shall her then own younger brother-in-law espouse in the following manner.
When he has, according to rule, espoused her, clad in white garments and pure in her observances, they shall approach each other once in each season, until issue.
Having given away his daughter to one man, the wise man should not give her away again. Having given her away once, if he gives her again, he incurs the guilt of ‘fraud towards men.’—‘(7l)
Even after having accepted the maiden in due form, one mat repudiate her, if she be blemished, or diseased, or corrupted, or betrothed by deception.
If a man gives away a defective maiden, without declaring the defects, one may annul that act of the wicked girl-betrother.
A man having business may go abroad, after having provided for the maintenance of his wife; for a wife, even though virtuous, may become corrupt, when distressed by want of subsistence.
When the husband has gone abroad after having provided for her subsistence, she shall live on, firmly devoted to restraint. When however he has gone without providing for it, she shall subsist by unobjectionable industries.
If the husband went abroad for some sacred duty, he should be awaited for eight years; if for learning, or for fame, six years; but three years, if for pleasure.
For one year the husband shall bear with a hating wife; after the year he shall wrest her property and cease to co-habit with her.
If the wife disregards her husband who is mad, or intoxicated, or afflicted by disease, she should be deprived of ornaments and appurtenances and abandoned for three months.
If, however, she shows aversion to one who is mad, or an outcast, or impotent, or seedless, or afflicted with foul disease, there shall be no desertion, nor the wresting of her property.
If the wife is a drunkard, or false in conduct, or rebellious, or diseased or mischievous, or wasteful,—she should be superseded.
The barren wife shall be superseded in the eighth year; in the tenth she whose children die off; in the eleventh she who bears only daughters; but immediately she who talks harshly.
But if a wife, who is an invalid, is well-disposed and endowed with modesty, she may be superseded after her consent has been obtained; and in no case is she to be disgraced.
On being superseded, if a wife, in anger, should go away from the house, she shall be either immediately confined, or cast off in the presence of the family.
If the wife, though forbidden, drinks wine even at festivals or visits, shows and assemblies, she shall be fined six ‘ Kṛṣṇalas ’.
When twice-born men wed women of their own as well as other castes, their seniority, honour and habitation shall be according to the order of their castes.
Of all wives, the wife of the man’s own caste, and never that of a different caste, shall attend to the husband’s personal service, as also to his daily sacred rites.
While the wife of the same caste is alive, if through folly, one causes these duties to be performed by another wife, he is a ‘ Brāhmaṇa-Cāṇḍāla ’, as has been held by the ancients.
One shall give his daughter in the proper form, even though she may not have attained (the age), to a bridegroom who is of exceptionally distinguished appearance, and her equal.
Well might the maiden, even though she may have reached puberty, remain in the house till her death; but the father shall never give her to a man destitute of good qualities.
Having reached puberty, the maiden may wait for three years; after that time, she shall procure a suitable husband.
When a maiden, when not given away, herself procures a husband, she incurs no sort of sin; nor does the man whom she weds.
When the girl chooses her own husband, she should not take away any ornaments given to her either by her father, or mother or brother; if she did take them, she would be a thief.
When a man takes away a maiden who has reached puberty, he shall pay no nuptial fee to the father,—who would fall off from his ownership by reason of thwarting her menses.
A man thirty years old shall marry a charming maiden twelve years old; or one twenty four years old, a damsel eight years old; in the event of his duties suffering, he may do it sooner.
The husband obtains his wife as a present from the gods, and not by his own wish; hence he should always support the faithful wife, thereby doing what is agreeable to the gods.
Women were created for the purpose of child-bearing, and men for the furfose of procreation. hence it is that Religious Rites have been ordained in the Veda as common between the man and his wife.
After the nuptial fee for a girl has been paid, if the man who paid the fee dies, the girl should be given to the younger brother-in-law, in case she consents.
Even a Śūdra should not take a nuptial fee, when he is giving away his daughter; by accepting a fee, what he does is disguised bartering.
Good men, both ancient and modern, have never committed the act, that having promised to one they gave her to another.
Nor indeed have we heard, even in former Cycles, of the covert sale of a daughter, for a price styled “nuptial fee.”
‘May mutual fidelity continue till death’,—this, in brief should be understood as the highest duty between husband and wife.
Man and wife, after they have passed through the rites, should always so exert themselves that they may not become separated and be unfaithful to each other.
Thus has been expounded to you the law relating to husband and wife, which is conducive to conjugal happiness,—as also the manner of obtaining children in times of distress; learn now the partition of inheritance.
After the death of the father and of the mother, the brothers, being assembled, shall divide equally the paternal property; while the parents are alive, they have no power.
The eldest brother alone may take the entire paternal property; the rest shall live under him, just as under their father.
By the mere birth of the eldest son, a man becomes ‘with son,’ and (hence) free from the debt to Pitṛs ; it is for this reason that he deserves the whole.
That son alone to whom the man transfers his debt, and through whom he attains immortality, is the ‘duty-born son;’ others are known as ‘lust-born.’
The eldest brother shall support his younger brothers, just as the father supports his sons; and the younger brothers, in duty bound, shall behave towards the eldest brother, like sons.
It is the eldest brother who advances the family, or ruins it; the eldest brother is worthy of the highest honour; the eldest brother is never ill-treated by good men.
If the eldest brother behaves as the eldest brother, he is like a mother, and like a father. If however he does not behave like the eldest brother, he shall be honoured simply as a kinsman.
Thus may they live either together, or separately, with a view to spiritual merit; by separate living merit prospers; hence separation is meritorious.
For the eldest, the additional portion shall consist of the twentieth part of the property, as also the best of all the chattels; half of that for the middlemost, and the fourth of that for the youngest.
The eldest and the youngest shall receive their property according to the rule just stated; to those other than the eldest and the youngest, would belong the middlemost share.
Among the goods of every kind, the first-born shall take the best; as also anything that may be particularly good; as well as the best of ten animals.
But there is to be no additional share ‘out of ten,’ if all the brothers are efficient in their occupations; some little thing however shall be given to the eldest, as a mark of respect.
After the ‘additional share’ has been thus deducted, equal shares shall be allotted. But if no additional share has been deducted, the allotment of shares shall be in this (following) manner,
The eldest son shall take one share in excess; the one born next to him a share and a half; and the younger ones one share each; such is the settled law.
To the maidens of the same caste, the brothers shall each severally give the fourth part of his share; those not inclined to give would be outcasts
One shall not divide an odd goat, or sheep, or an animal with uncleft hoofs; the odd goat or sheep is declared to belong to the eldest.
If the younger brother begets a son on the wife of the elder, the division in that case shall be equal; such is the settled law.
The Secondary cannot rightly be (equal to) the primary; because in procreation, the father is the primary, therefore he (the secondary) should be treated accordinc, to the law (stated before).
‘In case the younger son is born of the elder wife, and the elder one of the younger wife,—how would the partition be made?’—If such a doubt arises,—the son born of the elder wife shall take one bull as his ‘preferential share;’ the other bulls, which are not so good, shall belong to those who are junior to him, on account of the position of their mothers.—(122-123)
The elder son born of the younger wife may take (fifteen cows with) a bull as the sixteenth; the others may take shares according to the seniority of their mothers; such is the settled rule.
Among sons born of equal wives,—if there is no other distinction,—there is no seniority on account of their mothers; seniority is declared to be by birth only.
In the Subrahmaṇyā text also, the invocation has been declared as to be done by the son who is eldest by birth. Between sons conceived as twins, seniority has been declared to be dependent upon birth.
He who has no son may make his daughter an ‘appointed daughter’ in the following manner: He shall mark the declaration—‘The child that may bk born of her shall be the performer of my funeral rites’.
In ancient times Dakṣa Prajāpati himself made ‘appointed daughters’ in this same manner, for the purpose of multiplying his race.
He gave ten to Dharma, thirteen to Kaśyapa, and twenty-seven to King Soma,—having honoured them with an affectionate heart.
The son is as one’s own self, and the daughter is equal to the son; hence so long as she is there in her own real character, how can anyone else take his property?
Whatever may be the separate property of the mother is the share of the unmarried daughter alone; and the daughter’s son shall inherit the entire property of the man who has no son.
The daughter’s son should inherit the entire property of the sonless father; he shall also offer two cakes—to the ‘father’ and to the ‘maternal grandfather.’
In this world, between the son’s son and the daughter’s son there is no difference, in law; for the father and mother of each of them were both born of h is own body.
But if a son happen to be born after the daughter has been ‘appointed,’ the division must be equal; as there is no seniority for the woman.
If the appointed daughter happen to die without a son, the husband of that appointed daughter may, without hesitation, take that property.
Either appointed on not appointed, if a daughter bears a son to a husband of equal status, through that son does the maternal grandfather become endowed with a ‘son’s son’; he shall offer the funeral cake and inherit his property.
Through the son one conquers the worlds, through the grandson he obtains immortality, and through the son’s grandson he attains the regions of the Sun.
Because the Son delivers his father from the hell called ‘Put,’ therefore has he been called ‘Putra,’ ‘Deliverer from Put,’ by the Self-existent One Himself.
Between the Son’s son and the Daughter’s son there is no difference in the world; since the daughter’s son also, like the son’s son, saves the man in the next world.
The son of the Appointed Daughter shall offer the first cake to his mother, the second to her father and the third to his father’s father.
If one has an adopted son endowed with all good qualities, he shall inherit his property, even though he may have come from another family.
The adopted son shall not take the family-name or the property of his progenitor; the cake follows the family-name and the property; for him therefore who gives away his son the funeral offerings cease.
The offspring of a wife not ‘authorised,’ and the offspring obtained from her younger brother-in-law by a woman who has already got a son,—both of these are undeserving of a share; one being born of an adulterer, and the other being the product of lust.
The made child of an ‘authorised’ woman, if not begotten in the prescribed manner, is not entitled to the paternal property; as he is procreated by outcasts.
The son born of the ‘authorised’ woman shall inherit, like the ‘legitimate’ son; as legally that seed is of the owner of the soil and the offspring belongs to him.
This rule refers to the case where the dead brother was one who had separated from the surviving brother; while the preceding verse was meant for that where the two brothers lived together. This is the only difference between this and the foregoing rules.
If a woman, without being ‘authorised,’ bears a son either to her broth er-in-law or to some other person, that son they declare to be ‘ lust-born,’ ‘incapable of inheritance’ and ‘ born in vain.’
This rule should be understood as applying to partition among sons born of wives of the same caste; listen to that applying to that among sons born to one man of several and diverse wives.
If to a Brāhmaṇa there be four wives in due order,—for partition among the sons born of these, the rule has been declared to be as follows.
The ploughman, the breeding bull, the conveyance, the ornament, and the house shall be given as the ‘preferential share’ to the Brāhmaṇa , as also one principal share.
Out of the estate the Brāhmaṇa shall take three shares; the son of the Kṣatriya mother two shares; the son of the Vaiśya mother a share and a half; and the son of the Śūdra mother one share.
The man knowing the law shall divide the entire estate into ten parts, and then make an equitable division according to the following rule.
The Brāhmaṇa shall take four shares, and the son of the Kṣatriya mother three shares; the son of the Vaiśya mother shall take two shares, and the son of the Śūdra mother shall take one share.
Whether a Brāhmaṇa has a son or no son, he shall not, according to law, allot more than the tenth part to the son of the Śūdra wife.
Of the Brāhmaṇa , the Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya , the son born of a Śūdra wife is not an inheritor of property; his property shall consist of whatever his father may give to him.
Or, all the sons of twice-born men, born of wives of the same caste, shall divide the property equally, after the others have given to the eldest his ‘preferential share.’
For the Śūdra is ordained a wife of his own caste only, and no other; and all the sons born of her shall be entitled to equal shares, even if there be a hundred sons.
Among the twelve kinds of sons that Manu sprung from the Self-existent one has mentioned,—six are kinsmen as well as heirs, and six are kinsmen, not heirs.
The ‘ Aurasa ,’ ‘Body-born,’ the ‘ Kṣetraja ,’ ‘Soil-born,’ the ‘ Datta ,’ ‘given’ (adopted), the ‘ Kṛtrima ,’ ‘appointed,’ the ‘ Gūḍhotpanna ,’ ‘Secretly born,’ and the ‘ Apaviddha ,’ ‘Cast off,’—these six are both heirs and kinsmen.
The man who tries to cross the gloom with the help of bad sons obtains results similar to those obtained by one who tries to cross the water with the help of unsound boats.
If the ‘Soil-born’ and the ‘body-born’ sons are both entitled to inherit the same property, each shall receive that property which belongs to his own father, and not the other.
The ‘legitimate’ (body-born) son is alone the owner of the paternal estate; but in order toavoid unkindness, he shall provide subsistence for the rest.
When the legitimate son is dividing the paternal estate, he shall give to the ‘ Kṣetraja ’ son one-sixth or one-fifth part of the father’s property.
The ‘body-born’ and the ‘soil-born’ are entitled to inherit the father’s property; while the other ten inherit the ‘family-title’ and a share in the property, according to their order
Him whom a man himself begets in his own sanctified ‘soil,’—one shall know as the ‘body-born’ (legitimate) son, (declared) to be the first in order.
If a son is born of the wife of a man, either dead or impotent or diseased, by one who has been duly ‘authorised,’—that son is declared to be ‘ kṣetraja ’ ‘soil-born.’
When in times of distress, the mother or the father affectionately gives away, with water-libations, a worthy son,—that son is called ‘given’ (adopted).
When one appoints a son who is worthy, capable of discerning right and wrong, and endowed with filial virtues,—that son is to be known as “appointed.’
If a son is born in a man’s house, and it is not known whose he is,—this son ‘secretly born’ in the house shall belong to him of whose wife he is born.
If a man takes up a son deserted by his parents, or by either of them, he is called the ‘cast off son.’
If a maiden secretly bears a son in her father’s house, that son, born of a maiden, should be declared as ‘maiden-born’ by name, and to belong to the man who marries her.
If one marries, knowingly or unknowingly, a pregnant maiden, the child in her womb belongs to him who marries her, and is called ‘received along with the wife.’
If a man buys a boy, worthy or unworthy, from his father and mother, with a view to making him his son, that son is called ‘bought.’
If a woman abandoned by her husband, or a widow, of her own accord, marries again and bears a son, that son is called ‘the son of a re-married woman.’
In case she be still a virgin, or having gone away comes back,—she is fit to undergo re-marriage with her second husband.
If a boy, being deprived of his parents, or being abandoned by them without cause, offers himself to a man,—he is called the ‘ self-offered son.’
If a Brāhmaṇa , through lust, begets a son on a Śūdra woman, he is as a corpse, even though living, and hence called the ‘living corpse.’
If a son is born to a Śūdra from a female slave, or from the female slave of a slave, he shall, when permitted, receive a share; such is the settled law.
These eleven, the ‘soil-born’ and the rest, as here described, the wise ones call ‘substitutes of a son,’—taken with a view to the failure of a religious duty.
Those sons born of the seed of strangers that have been described here by the way, belong to him from whose seed they are born, and not to any other person.
Among brothers, born of the same father, if even one have a son, Manu has declared all of them to be ‘with son,’ through that son.
Among all the wives of one man, if one have a son, Manu has declared all of them to be ‘with son,’ through that son.
On the failure of each superior kind of son, each next inferior one is entitled to inheritance; if there be several of the same class, all shall share the property.
Sons alone shall inherit the father’s property, not brothers or fathers; but the father and brothers shall inherit the property of one who dies sonless.
To three should water-libation be offered; to three is the cake offered; the fourth is the giver of these offerings; there can be no fifth.
The property shall always devolve upon him who is nearest to the (deceased) ‘ Sapiṇḍa ’; after these either a ‘ Sakulya ’; or the Spiritual Preceptor, or the pupil.
But, on the failure of all, the property shall be taken by Brāhmaṇas , learned in the Vedas, pure and self-controlled; in this manner the law would not be violated.
The property of the Brāhmaṇa shoved never be taken by the King,—such is the law; but in the case of other castes, the king shall take the property, in the absence of all heirs.
In the case of a man dying childless, if an issue is raised from a member of the same family, all the property that there may be shall be delivered to that child.
But if two sons, born of two men, contend for the property in the mother’s possession, each shall take, to the exclusion of the other, what belonged to his own father.
When the mother has died, all the uterine brothers and uterine sisters shall divide the mother’s property equally.
Even to the daughters of those daughters something shall be lovingly given, as is quite proper, out of the property of their maternal grandmother.
What is given before the fire, what is given at the time of departure, what is given in token of love, and what is received from the brother, the mother and the father,—has been declared to be ‘ Strīdhana ’ (the exclusive property of the woman).
Also the gift that is subsequently made to her by her loving husband, shall go to her offspring, if she dies while her husband is living.
It is ordained that the property of women married by the ‘ Brāhma ,’ the ‘ Daiva ,’ the ‘ Ārṣa ,’ the ‘ Gāndharva ,’ or the ‘ Prājāpatya ’ form, shall go to her husband alone, if she dies childless.
The property that may have been given to a woman by her father shall be taken by the daughter of the Brāhamaṇa -caste; or it shall belong to the child of that daughter.
Women shall never make a hoard out of the family-property common to many, nor out of their own property, without the husband’s permission.
The ornament worn by the woman during her husband’s life-time, her heirs shall not divide; if they divide it, they become outcasts.
Eunuchs and outcasts, those born blind or deaf, idiots and the dumb, as well as those deficient in any organ, are entitled to no shares.
But it is fair that the wise man shall give even to all these food and clothing to the best of his ability; if he does not give it at all, he becomes an outcast.
If the eunuch and the rest should somehow happen to have longing for a wife, the child of such of them as have issue is entitled to inheritance.
Whatever property the eldest brother acquires after the death of the father, a share of that shall belong to the younger brothers, if they are devoted to learning.
But if all of them are unlearned, and the property is acquired by their labour,—the division in that case shall be equal, the property being not ancestral. such is the settled rule.
The gains of learning shall be the sole property of the man by whom they have been acquired; as also friendly presents, marriage.—presents, and presents received in connection with the ‘honey—mixture.’
Among brothers, if any one, being quite competent through his own profession, does not desire the property, he shall be debarred from his share, after a little has been given to him by way of maintenance.
If one of them acquires something by his own effort, without interfering with the patrimony,—that property, being acquired by his own labour, he need not give to others, unless he himself wishes it.
If the father recovers a lost ancestral property, he shall not, unless he so wishes, share it with his sons,—being, as it is his self-acquired property.
If brothers, living together, after having divided once, happen to make a second partition, the division in that case shall be equal; in such cases there is no ‘primogeniture.’
If the eldest or the youngest of the brothers should be deprived of his shares,—or if either of them dies,—his share does not become lost.
His uterine brothers, coming together, shall divide it equally; as also the united brothers and consanguineous sisters.
If an eldest brother, through avarice, defrauds the younger ones, he shall lose his ‘seniority’ and his share, and shall also be punished by the king.
All brothers addicted to evil deeds are unworthy of having property; and the elder brother shall not have a separate hoard without making a contribution to his younger brothers.
Among undivided brothers, if there is a joint concern,—the father shall, on no account, make an unequal division among his sons.
If a son is born after partition, he shall receive the property of the father alone; or if any other sons be reunited, he would share it with them.
The property of a childless son shall be inherited by his mother; and if the mother also is dead, his father’s mother shall receive that property.
After all the assets and liabilities have been duly distributed, if something be discovered afterwards,—all this must be divided equally.
A cloth, a conveyance, an ornament, cooked food, water, women, what is conducive to welfare and pasture-ground,—these they declare to be impartible.
Thus has been expounded to you Partition, and the appointing of the ‘soil-born’ and other kinds of sons in due order. Now learn the law relating to Gambling.
The King shall exclude from his realm Gambling and Betting; these two evils bring about the destruction of the kingdoms of princes.
Gambling and Betting are open theft; the King shall always be careful in suppressing them.
That which is done through inanimate things is called ‘Gambling’; while what is done through animate things is to be known as ‘Betting.’
He who either does the gambling or betting himself, or helps others to do them,—all these the King shall strike; as also those Śūdras who assume the guise of twice-born men.
Gamblers, dancers, cruel men, men belonging to heretical sects, men addicted to evil deeds, dealers in wine,—these the King shall instantly banish from his town.
These disguised thieves, living in the King’s realm, constantly harass the well-behaved people by their evil deeds.
In former cycles gambling has been seen to be the great source of enmity; the wise man shall therefore not have recourse to gambling, even in joke.
If a man has recourse, either openly or secretly, to this (vice), the form of punishment inflicted upon him shall be in accordance with the King’s discretion.
The Kṣatriya , the Vaiśya and the Śūdra , when unable to pay a fine, shall discharge the liability by labour; the Brāhmaṇa may pay it by instalments.
On women, boys, men out of their minds, the old, the poor and the sick, the king shall inflict punishment with creepers, barks, ropes and so forth.
If the officers deputed to look after the business of suitors should, fired by the heat of wealth, hamper that business,—these the King shall render penniless.
Forgers of royal proclamations, sowers of disaffection among the people, the slayers of women, infants and Brāhmaṇas , and those serving his enemies,—the king shall put to death.
Whatever has been finally settled and whatever punishment has been inflicted,—he shall accept as lawfully done, and shall not annul it
If the councillors or the judge decide a case unfairly, that case the King himself shall revise and fine them one thousand.
The slayer of a Brāhmaṇa , the drinker of wine, the thief and the violator of the preceptor’s bed,—all these individually should be known as men who have committed heinous crimes.
Even on all these four, if they do not perform the expiatory penance, the king shall inflict corporal punishment along with fine, in accordance with the law.
For violating the preceptor’s bed the sign of the female organ shall be branded; for drinking wine that of the tavern; for theft that of the dog’s foot; and for killing a Brāhmaṇa that of a headless man.
Debarred from entertainments, debarred from sacrifices, debarred from education, excluded from all religious acts, these shall wander over the earth; abject and despised.
Being branded, these shall be abandoned by Kinsmen and relations, deprived of all sympathy and greetings;—such is the teaching of manu.
But men of the senior castes, who perform the expiatory penances, as prescribed, shall not be branded on the forehead by the king; they shall be made to pay the highest amercement.
For offences committed by the Brāhmaṇa the middle-most amercement shall be inflicted on him; or he shall be banished from the kingdom, along with his goods and chattels.
But others who have committed these offences unintentionally, deserve to have the entire property confiscated; and death, in the case of their being intentional.
The righteous King shall not appropriate the property of the man guilty of a heinous crime; if, through greed, he takes it, he becomes tainted with that guilt.
He shall deposit such property in the water and offer it to Varuṇa , or bestow it on a Brāhmaṇa endowed with learning and character.
Varuṇa i s the lord of punishment, as he holds the sceptre over the King; while the Brāhmaṇa , well versed in the Veda, is the lord of the whole world.
In a country where the King avoids the income of wealth from sinners, men are, in time, born to be long-lived the crops of husbandmen grow, according as they are sown; children do not die, and no mis-shaped child is born.
If a low-born person intentionally harasses a Brāhmaṇa , the King shall strike him with various terror-striking forms of corporal punishment.
The sin incurred by the king in striking one who does not deserve it, is the same as that in acquitting one who deserves to be struck; but merit accrues to him if he chastises justly.
This has been expounded at length-investigation of suits between two litigants, bearing upon the eighteen titles of dispute.
The king thus duly doing his lawful work, may seek to acquire tracts of land not already acquired, and settle those already acquired.
Having duly settled his kingdom, and having built forts according to the institutes, he shall apply his best efforts to the ‘removal of thorns.’
Kings, intent upon protecting the people, go to heaven, by protecting the Well-behaved and by removing the ‘thorns’
If a king does not repress thieves and yet receives his taxes, his kingdom becomes perturbed and he falls off from heaven.
If however his kingdom, resting on the strength of his arms, is secure from danger,—it flourishes constantly, like a well-watered tree.
The spy-eyed king shall discover the two kinds of thieves who take away the property of other men, those that are ‘open’ and those ‘concealed’
Of these, the ‘open’ cheats are those who make a living by dealing in various commodities, and the ‘concealed’ cheats are burglars, robbers in forests and so forth.
Those who take bribes, dissemblers, cheats and gamblers, fortune-tellers and palmists.
Misbehaving High officials and physicians, art-exhibitors, and clever harlots.
These and others of the same kind one should know as the open ‘thorns’ of the people; and others, who are rogues in the guise of gentlemen, as ‘dissemblers.’
Having discovered them through well-behaved and disguised men following the same occupations, as also through spies variously disguised, he shall exterminate them and bring them under his control.
Having truly proclaimed their crimes in connection with their respective acts, the king shall duly inflict punishment on them, in accordance with their crimes and capacities.
The crimes of evil-minded thieves secretly prowling over the earth cannot be suppressed without punishment.
Assembly-rooms, water-drinking booths, sweetmeat shops, brothels, taverns and victualler’s shops, cross-roads, trees of worship, festive gatherings and theatres;
He shall detect and exterminate them by means of clever reformed thieves, who associate with them, follow them and become apprised of their machinations.
They shall bring them together by means of offers of food and drink, by introducing to Brāhmaṇas , and by exhibition of martial feats.
Those among them who do not come, and those who are careful in their dealings with the older men,—these the king shall attack by force and destroy, along with their friends, kinsmen and relations.
The righteous king shall not put a thief to death unless caught with the stolen goods; when however one is caught with the stolen goods, and the implements of burglary, he may, without hesitation, put him to death.
He shall also strike all those in a village who supply food for thieves or provide room for the goods.
If those persons who are entrusted with the work of guarding the realm, and those vassals who have been ordered to assist, should remain neutral during the raids (against thieves), the king shall punish them speedily, like thieves.
If one who subsists on religion deviates from religious ordinances, he shall punish him severely by a fine,—fallen as he is from his duty.
If people do not hasten to assist, to the best of their power, whenever a village is attacked, or a dyke is breaking, or a highway robbery is being committed,—they should be banished along with their chattels.
Those who rob the king’s treasuries and those who are disaffected towards him, as also those who conspire with his enemies,—the king shall strike with various forms of punishment.
If thieves commit thefts at night, after breaking into a house, the king shall cut off their hands and have them impaled on a pointed stake; on the first conviction he should have two fingers of the cut-purse amputated; on the second a hand and a foot; and on the third he should be put to death.
The king shall strike like thieves those who provide fire, offer food and supply arms and lodging, as also those who abet their escape.
If a man breaks open a tank, he shall be slain in the water, or by simple form of death; or, he may repair the damage and be made to fay the highest amercement.
Those who break into a storehouse, an armoury, or a temple, and those who steal elephants, horses and chariots,—he shall put to death without hesitation.
If a man take away the water of a tank dug in ancient times, or cut off the supply of water,—he shall be made to pay the lowest amercement.
If one throws filth upon the public road, except in dire necessity,—he shall pay two Kārṣāpaṇas and clean the filth immediately.
But a person in urgent necessity, an aged person, a pregnant woman, or a child should be reprimanded and the filth should be cleaned;—such is the law.
All physicians dealing dishonestly are liable to punishment; in the case of patients other than human, the lowest, and in that of human patients, the middlemost amercement.
He who destroys a crossing, a flag, a pole or images, shall repair the whole of it and shall pay five hundred.
For adulterating unadulterated commodities, and for breaking or wrongly boring gems, the punishment shall be the first amercement.
The man who treats equals as unequals in value should receive the punishment of the first or the middlemost amercement.
The king shall establish prisons all along the public road,—where the suffering and disfigured offenders might be seen.
Him in who breaks the wall, or fills up the ditch, or breaks the gate—he shall instantly banish.
In all cases of malevolent rites, the fine shall be two hundred; as also in a case of magic spell by persons not related, or in those of various kinds of sorcery.
He who sells what is not-seed, or picks out the seed, or transgresses the bounds (of propriety) shall suffer ‘mutilation’ as the penalty.
If the goldsmith, the worst of all ‘thorns,’ behaves dishonestly, the king shall have him cut to pieces with razors.
For the stealing of agricultural implements, of arms or of medicines, the king shall determine the punishment, after taking into consideration the time and uses.
The master and the minister, the capital city, the people, the treasury and the army, and the ally,—these are the seven constituents; and the kingdom is described as having ‘seven limbs.’
Among these seven constituents of the kingdom stated in due order, injury to each preceding one is to be regarded as more serious.
Yet in the kingdom consisting of the ‘seven limbs’ interlaced like the ‘triple staff,’—since their qualities are mutually helpful,—no one of them is superior.
Each ‘limb’ is particularly qualified for the fulfilment of a distinct purpose; and hence each is declared to be the most important in reference to that purpose which is fulfilled by its means.
The king shall constantly ascertain his own and his enemy’s strength through spies, through display of energy and also through the actual carrying out of undertakings.
The king shall begin operations after having taken into consideration all calamities and vices, and their relative importance.
Tired and tired, over again he should begin his operations; for fortune favours the man who undertakes operations.
The actions of the king constitute the ‘ Kṛta ’, the ‘ Tretā ’, the ‘ Dvāpara ’ and the ‘ Kali ’ cycles; as it is the king that is called the ‘cycle.’
Asleep, he represents ‘ Kali ;’ awake, the ‘ Dvāpara ’ cycle; ready to act, the ‘ Tretā ’; and actually acting, the ‘ Kṛta ’ cycle.
The king shall emulate the energetic activity of Indra , of Arka , of Vāyu , of Yama , of Varuṇa , of Chandra , of Agni and of Pṛthvī .
As Indra showers rain during four months of the year, so shall the king, acting like Indra, shower benefits on his people.
Just as during eight months, Āditya draws up water with his rays, even so the king shall draw taxes from the people,—this being the function of arka.
As Vāyu moves about, entering all beings,—even so shall the king penetrate everywhere through his spies;—this is the function of Vāyu .
As one is always found bound up with ropes by Varuṇa , even so shall the king punish the wicked; this is the function of Varuṇa .
The people rejoice at seeing the full moon; the king at whose appearance the people rejoice in that manner is a king who fulfills the functions of the moon.
He shall always be endowed with brilliant energy and ardent in his wrath against offenders; he shall exterminate his disaffected vassals; this is the function of agni.
As the earth sustains all beings equally, so does the king support all beings; and this is the function of Pṛthivī .
Betaking himself to these and other methods, the king, ever alert, shall restrain thieves in his own realm as well as in that of others.
Even when fallen in the deepest distress, the king shall not provoke the Brāhmaṇas ; for if provoked, they would ruin him, along with his army and conveyances.
Who could escape ruin after having provoked those by whom fire was rendered all-devouring, by whom the ocean was made undrinkable and by whom the moon was made to wax and wane?
Who could prosper after injuring those who, on being provoked, would create other worlds and other guardians of the regions, and who would make the Gods cease to be Gods?
What man, desirous of living, would injure them, depending on whom the world and the gods exist, and whose wealth consists of the Veda?
Learned or unlearned, the Brāhmaṇa is a great divinity; just as consecrated or unconsecrated, the fire is a great divinity.
Even though in the cremation-ground, the brilliant fire is not defiled, and it flourishes again when libations are poured unto it at sacrifices.
When the Kṣatriya shall become too over-bearing in every way towards Brāhmaṇas , the Brāhmaṇa himself shall be their restraining influence; as the Kṣatriya has his source in the Brāhmaṇa .—320
Fire sprang from water, the Kṣatriya from the Brāhmaṇa , and iron from stone; the all-penetrating force of each of these becomes extinguished in its source.
The Kṣatriya flourishes not without the Brāhmaṇa ; the Brāhmaṇa prospers not without the Kṣatriya ; the Brāhmaṇa and the Kṣatriya , when united, prosper here as also in the other world.
Bestowing his wealth, obtained from all kinds of fines, upon Brāhmaṇas , and making over the kingdom to his son, the king shall bring about his departure in battle.
Acting in this manner, and ever intent upon his Kingly Duties, the king shall order all his servants to work for the good of the people.
Thus has been expounded the whole of the eternal Law relating to the Duties of the King; the law relating to the Vaiśya and the Śūdra respectively should be understood to be as follows.
After having his sacraments performed, the Vaiśya shall take a wife and apply himself entirely to agriculture and the tending of catlle.
Prajāpati , having created cattle, made them over to the Vaiśya; while to the Brāhmaṇā and the Kṣatriya he made over all creatures.
The Vaiśya shall never conceive the wish—‘I will not tend cattle;’ and so long as the Vaiśya is willing, they should not be tended by any one else.
He shall find out the relative value of gems, pearls, corals, metals, woven cloths, perfumes and condiments.
He should be acquainted with the manner of sowing seeds, with the good and bad qualities of the soil; he should know all kinds of weights and measures.
Also the excellences and defects of commodities, the advantages and disadvantages relating to countries, the profit and loss on merchandise and also cattle-breeding.
He shall know also the wages of servants, the several languages of men, the manner of keeping goods, and also their purchase and sale.
He shall put forth his best efforts towards increasing his property in a righteous manner; and he shall zealously give food to all beings.
For the Śūdra the highest duty conducive to his best welfare is to attend upon such Brāhmaṇa house-holders as are learned in the Vedas and famous.
If he is pure, attendant upon his superiors, of gentle speech, free from pride, and always dependent upon the Brāhmaṇa ,—he attains a higher caste.
Thus has the excellent law for the conduct of the castes in normal times been expounded; now listen in due order to what forms their duty in abnormal times.
The three twice-born castes, devoted to their duties, shall study; but of these the Brāhmaṇa alone shall expound it, not the other two; such is the established law.
The Brāhmaṇa should know the means of livelihood for all men; he shall duly expound them to the others and himself do accordingly.
The Brāhmaṇa is the lord of the castes, on account of his distinctive qualities, of the superiority of his origin, of his observance of restrictive rules, of the peculiar character of his sanctification.
The Brāhmaṇa , the Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya are the three twice-born castes; the fourth is the one caste, Śūdra ; there is no fifth.
Among all castes, those only who are born of consorts wedded in the natural order, as virgins of equal status, are to be regarded as the same (as their father).
The sons begotten by twice-born men on wives of the next lower castes, they declare to be equal, tainted as they are by the defect of their mothers.
Such is the eternal law relating to those born of wives of the next lower castes; know this (following) to be the right rule pertaining to those born of wives two or three degrees lower.
From the Brāhmaṇa on a Vaiśya maiden is born the ‘ Ambaṣṭha ’ and on a Śūdra maiden the ‘ Niṣāda ,’ who is called ‘ Pārośora .’
From the Kṣatriya on a Śūdra maiden is born a being called ‘Ugra,’ of the stuff of the Kṣatriya and Śūdra , cruel in his deeds and dealings.
Children of the Brāhmaṇa from the three lower castes, of the Kṣatriya from the two lower castes, and of the Vaiśya from the one lower caste,—these six have been declared to be ‘lowborn.’
One born from the Kṣatriya on the Brāhmaṇa maiden is ‘ Sūta ’ in caste; and the sons born on the Kṣatriya and the Brāhmaṇa maiden from the vaiśya are ‘ Māgadha ’ and ‘ Vaideha ’ respectively.
From the Śūdra on the Vaiśya , the Kṣatriya and the Brāhmaṇa maiden are born the mixed castes, ‘ Āyogava ,’ Kṣattṛ and the ‘ Caṇḍāla ,’ the lowest of men.
As the ‘ Ambaṣṭha ’ and the ‘ugra’ are born in the ‘natural order’ from a woman two degrees removed,—even so have been declared to be the ‘ Kṣattṛ ’ and the ‘ Vaideha ,’ though born in the ‘inverse order.’
The sons of twice-born men from women of the next lower caste, who have been enunciated in due order, are called by the name of the lower caste, on account of the taint attaching to their mothers.
The ‘ Āvṛta ’ is born from the Brāhmaṇa on the ‘ugra’ maiden, the ‘ Ābhīra ’ on the ‘ Ambaṣṭha ’ maiden and the ‘ Dhigvaṇa ’ on the ‘ Āyogava ’ maiden.
One born from the ‘ Kṣattṛ ’ on the ‘ Ugrā ’ woman is called ‘ Śvapāka ;’ and one begotten by the ‘ Vaideha ’ on the ‘ Ambaṣṭha ’ woman is called ‘ Veṇa .’
The sons that the twice-born men beget on wives of equal caste, but who, not fulfilling their sacred duties, become excluded from the Sāvitrī —should be designated as ‘ Vrātyas ’ (apostates).
From the ‘Apostate’ Brāhmaṇa is born the evil- natured ‘ Bhṛjjakaṇṭaka ,’ the Āvantya , the ‘ Vāṭadhāna ’ the ‘ Puṣpadha ,’ and the ‘ Śaikha .’
From the ‘Apostate’ Kṣatriya is born the ‘Jhalla,’ the ‘Malla,’ the ‘Licchivi,’ the ‘ Naṭa ,’ the ‘ Karaṇa ’ the ‘Khasa’ and the ‘ Draviḍa .’
‘Confused castes’ are produced by infidelity among the castes, by the marrying of women unfit for marriage, and by the neglect of one’s duties.
I am going to describe those persons of mixed origin who are born in the natural and in the inverse order and are mutually connected.
the ‘ Sūta ’ the ‘Vaideha,’ the ‘ Caṇḍāla ,’ the lowest of men, the ‘ Māgadha ,’ the ‘ Kṣattṛ ’ caste, and the ‘ Āyogava .’
These six beget similar castes on women belonging to the same caste as themselves; so also those belonging to the mother’s caste procreate (on women of the same caste), as also on women of higher castes.
As to one his own alter-ego is born from two out of the three nearest castes, as also from his own caste,—even so is the order among those out of the outer circle.
Those also beget on each other’s wives several ‘alien’ sons, greatly tainted and despised.
As the Śūdra begets an ‘alien’ being on a Brāhmaṇa woman,—even so an alien propagates on females of the four castes, a still more alien being.
Aliens behaving discordantly, beget fifteen castes, still more alien, disgraced and not disgraced.
The ‘Dasyu’ begets on the ‘Āyogava,’ the ‘Sairandhra,’ skilled in toilet and attendance, who, though not a slave, makes his living like a slave, and also lives by catching animals.
But the ‘ Vaideha ’ begets the Madhūka-like ‘ Maitreyaka ,’ who constantly praises men, and serves as the bell-ringer at sunrise.
The ‘ Niṣāda ’ begets the ‘ Mārgava ’ or ‘ Dāsa ,’ who subsists by working the boat, and whom the inhabitants of Āryāvarta call ‘Kaivarta.’
These three, devoid of caste, are severally born from ‘ Āyogava ’ women, who wear the clothes of the dead, are ignoble, and eat despised food.
From the ‘ Niṣāda ’ is born of the ‘ Kārāvara ,’ who works in leather; and from the ‘ Vaiḍehaka ’ the ‘ Andhra ’ and the ‘ Meda ,’ who have their dwellings outside the village.
On the ‘ Vaideha ’ woman from the ‘ Caṇḍāla ’ is born the ‘ Paṇḍusopāka ’ who deals in bamboos; as also the ‘ Āhiṇḍika ’ from the ‘ Niṣāda .’—( 37 )
By the ‘ Caṇḍāla ,’ on the ‘ Pukkasa ’ woman is begotten the ‘ Sopāka ,’ whose livelihood consists of death, and who are wicked and despised by good people.
The ‘ Niṣāda ’ woman bears to the ‘ Caṇḍāla ’ the son called ‘ Antyāvasāyin ,’ working in the cremation-ground, despised even by out-casts.
These castes, proceeding from mixtures, have been described in relation to their fathers and mothers; and whether manifest or unmanifest, they may be known by their occupations.
Six sons born or women of the same caste and of those of the next lower castes partake of the character of ‘twice-born’ persons. But all those born of violation have been declared to be of the nature of Śūdras .
By the force of austerities and the seed they attain higher or lower rank among men, through birth, cycle after cycle.
But by the omission of the sacred rites, and also by their neglect of Brāhmaṇas , the following Kṣatriya castes have gradually sunk to the position of the low-born.
The Puṇḍrakas , the Coḍas , the Draviḍas , the Kāmbojas , the Yavanas, the Śākas , the Pāradas , the Pahlavas, the Cīnas , the Kirātas , the Daradas and the Khaśas.
All those races of the world which are outside the pale of the people ‘born of the mouth, the arms, the thighs and the feet,’—speaking the ‘barbaric’ or the ‘refined’ language—are called ‘Dasyu.’
The base-born sons of the ‘twice-born,’ as also those who have been declared to be ‘born of transgression,’ shall subsist by lowly services of ‘twice-born’ persons.
For Sūtas , the management of horses and chariots; for Ambaṣṭhas , the art of healing; for Vaidehakas , the service of women; and for Māgadhas , trade.
For Niṣādas , the killing of fish; for Āyogavas , carpentry; and for medas, andhras, Cuñcus and Madgus, the killing of wild animals.
For Kṣattṛs , Ugras and Pukkasas, the killing and catching of animals living underground; for Dhigvaṇas , work in leather; and for Veṇas the beating of drums.
Near worshipped trees and cremation-grounds, on hills and in groves, these shall dwell, duly marked, subsisting by their respective occupations.
The dwelling of Caṇḍālas and Śvapacas shall be outside the village; they shall be made ‘ Apapātra ,’ and their wealth shall consist of dogs and donkeys.
The clothes of dead bodies shall be their dress; they shall eat in broken dishes; their ornaments shall be of iron, and they shall be constantly wandering.
One who follows the law shall not seek intercourse with them; their transactions shall be among themselves and their marriages with their equals.
Their food should be given to them, through others, and in a broken dish; they shall not wander about in villages or cities during the night.
During the day they may go about on business distinguished by royal signs; they shall carry out corpses of people without relations; such is the law.
They shall always execute criminals, in accordance with law, under the orders of the king; and they shall take away the clothes, the beds and the ornaments of those executed.
The man of impure origin, who is devoid of caste, unknown, a non-Aryan, even though having the appearance of an Aryan,—one shall discover by his acts.
Snobbishness, harshness, cruelty, and proneness to neglect duties, mark the man of impure origin in this world.
The base-born man bears the character or his father, or of his mother, or of both; he can never conceal his origin.
Even when one is born in a great family, if there be a confusion regarding his parentage, he surely imbibes the traits thereof, to a greater or less extent.
That kingdom in which such caste-defilers are born of criminal intercourses, speedily perishes, along with the people.
For aliens perfection is secured by unrequitedly giving up the body for the sake of Brāhmaṇas and cows, and in defence of women and children.
Abstention from injuring, truthfulness, abstention from unlawful appropriation, purity and control of the sense-organs,—this Manu has declared to be the sum and substance of duty for the four castes.
If the child born from a Śūdra woman to a Brāhmaṇa goes on being wedded to a superior person,—the inferior attains the superior caste, within the seventh generation.
The Śūdra attains the position of the Brāhmaṇa and the Brāhmaṇa sinks to the position of the Śūdra ; the same should be understood to be the case with the offspring of the Kṣatriya or of the vaiśya.
( question ).—If a child is somehow born to a Brāhmaṇa from a non-Aryan woman, and another is born to a non-Aryan from a Brāhmaṇa woman,—with which of these would the ‘superiority’ lie?
The decision is that—‘one born to an Ārya from a Non-Ārya woman may be an Ārya in quality; but one born to a Non-ārya even from an Ārya woman is always Non-Ārya ’
The settled law is that both these are unfit for the sacraments:—the former on account of the defect in his birth and the latter by reason of his being horn ‘in the inverse order.’
Just as good seed grown in a good soil turns out well, so is the child born to an Ārya from an Ārya woman worthy of all sacraments.
Some wise men extol the seed, while others the soil; while yet others extol both the seed and the soil. The decision on this point is as follows.
The seed sown on barren soil perishes prematurely; and soil without the seed would be a mere barren plot.
Because through the power of the seed, those born of animals became sages, honoured and extolled, therefore it is the seed that is more important.
Having examined the Non-ārya behaving like an Ārya and the Ārya behaving like the Non-Ārya , the creator declared ‘that these are neither equal nor unequal.’
Brāhmaṇas of pure Brāhmaṇa-birth , intent upon their duties, should duly perform the six acts in due order.
Teaching, studying, sacrificing for oneself, sacrificing for others, giving and receiving gifts are the six functions for the ‘first born’.
From among these six functions, three are his means of livelihood: viz ., sacrificing for others, Teaching and Receiving gifts from pure men.
From the Brāhmaṇa coming to the Kṣatriya , three of these functions cease;— viz ., Teaching, Sacrificing for others, and third, the Receiving of gifts.
For the Vaiśya also these three should cease,—such is the law; since Prajāpati Manu has not prescribed these duties for those two (castes).
For the Kṣatriya carrying of arms and weapons, and for the Vaiśya, trade, cattle-tending and agriculture, are the means of livelihood; while giving, studying and sacrificing constitute their duty.
Among their respective occupations, the most useful are—constant Vedic study for the Brāhmaṇa , protection for the Kṣatriya and commercial dealings for the Vaiśya.
If the Brāhmaṇa is unable to subsist by his own occupation as described above, he may make a living by the function of the Kṣatriya ; since this latter is next to him.
If he is unable to subsist by these two occupations, and the question arises as to how it should be,—he may live the living of the Vaiśya, having recourse to agriculture and cattle-tending.
But even when subsisting by the occupation of the Vaiśya, the Brāhmaṇa or the Kṣatriya shall carefully avoid agriculture, which involves injury to living creatures and is dependent upon others.
People think agriculture to be good; but that occupation is despised by the righteous; the iron-tipped wood injures the earth and the earthly creatures.
But there is this, that one who, under the stress of livelihood, renounces the strictness concerning his duties, may, for increasing his wealth, sell such commodities as are sold by Vaiśyas, with certain exceptions.
He shall avoid all savoury substances as also cooked food and sesamum, stores, salt, animals and human beings.
Every kind of woven article dyed (red) as well as that made of hemp, silk or wool, even when not dyed red; and also fruits and roots and medicinal herbs.
Water, weapons, poison, meat, soma and all kinds of perfume; milk, honey, curds, butter, oil, honey-wax, sugar and kuśa-grass.
All beasts of the forest, fanged animals, and birds, wine, indigo, lac, and also all one-hoofed animals.
But the agriculturist may, if he wishes, sell pure sesamum for sacred purposes, if he has cultivated them himself and has not kept these long.
If one does with sesamum anything else, except eating, anointing and giving,—he becomes a worm and plunges into the ordure of dogs, along with his ancestors.
By selling meat, lac and salt, the Brāhmaṇa becomes an outcast at once; and by selling milk the Brāhmaṇa becomes a Śūdra in three days.
By selling, through greed, other commodities, the Brāhmaṇa assumes, in seven nights, the character of the Vaiśya.
Savoury articles should be bartered for savoury articles, but never salt for another savoury article,—cooked food, for cooked food, and sesamum for corn, in equal quantities.
The Kṣatriya , fallen in adverse circumstances, shall subsist by means of all this; but he shall never think of arrogating to himself the higher occupations.
If a man of low caste, through greed, subsists by the occupations of his superiors, him the King shall deprive of his property and quickly banish.
Better one’s own duty imperfectly performed, and not the duty of another performed perfectly; he who subsists by the function of another, instantly falls off from his caste.
The Vaiśya, unable to subsist by his own occupations, may subsist by the occupations of the Śūdra , avoiding all improper acts. But he shall desist from them as soon as he is able to do so.
The Śūdra , unable to do service for twice-born people, and threatened with danger to his wife and sons, may subsist by the occupations of craftsmen.
That is, those occupations of craftsmen and other arts by the performance whereof the twice-born men are best served.
If a Brāhmaṇa , distressed through want of livelihood, pines, because resolved to stick to his own path, he does not adopt the occupation of the Vaiśya,—he shall adopt this (following) procedure.
Fallen into distress, the Brāhmaṇa may receive gifts from all; that anything which is pure should become defiled is not possible under the law.
No sin attaches to Brāhmaṇas , either by teaching or by sacrificing for others or by receiving reprehensible gifts; for they are like fire and water.
If a man, threatened with loss of life, eats food from stray sources, he does not become tainted with sin, just as Ākāśa is not defiled by mud.
Ajīgarta , buffering from hunger, went forward to kill his son; and as he sought a remedy for hunger, he did not become tainted with sin.
Vāmadeva , expert in the knowledge of right and wrong, when distressed, desired to eat dog’s flesh for saving his life,—and he did not become defiled.
Bharadvāja , a man of great austerities, accepted many cows from the carpenter Vṛdhu , when tormented by hunger, along with his sons, in a lonely forest.
Viśvāmitra , expert in the knowledge of right and wrong, when tormented by hunger, proceeded to eat the haunch of a dog, receiving it from the hands of a Caṇḍāla .
Among Receiving of Gifts, Sacrificing and Teaching, the Receiving of Gifts is the meanest, and the most reprehensible for the Brāhmaṇa , in respect of his life after death.
As for Teachng and Sacrificing, these are done always for only such men as have received the sacraments; while the Receiving of Gifts may be done even from the lowest-born Śūdra .—
By the muttering of sacred texts and by the offering of libations is the guilt incurred by teaching and sacrificing removed; while that incurred by receiving gifts is removed only by renouncing them and by austerities.
The Brāhmaṇa , unable to maintain himself, may take to gleaning ears of corn and picking up grains, even from stray places. Gleaning ears of corn is better than receiving gifts; and better even than picking up of grains.
If Brāhmaṇas , who have completed their study, suffer privation, or seek to obtain wealth and riches, they may beg of the king; and if he be unwilling to give, he should be given up.
Uncultivated land is less reprehensible than cultivated land; and among cows, goats, sheep, gold, grains, and food each preceding one is less reprehensible than the succeeding.
There are seven lawful sources of income: inheritance, acquisition, purchase, conquest, investment, industry and receiving of proper gifts.
Learning, handicrafts, working on hire, service, cattle-tending, trade, agriculture, contentment, begging and money-lending,—these are the ten means of livelihood.
The Brāhmaṇa or the Kṣatriya must not lend money on interest; but he may advance a little to unrighteous men for sacred purposes.
The Kṣatriya , who, in times of distress, takes the fourth fart, becomes freed from sin, if he protects the people to the best of his ability.
Conquest is his peculiar duty; and he should never turn back in danger; he shall realise the legal tax from the Vaiśya, after protecting the people;
From the people the tax on grains shall be one-eighth, and one-twentieth (on gold), with the minimum of one ‘ Kārṣāpaṇa ’; Śūdras , craftsmen and artisans discharge their dues by work.
The Śūdra , seeking a livelihood, may serve the Kṣatriya ; or the Śūdra may seek to subsist by serving a wealthy Vaiśya.
He shall serve Brāhmaṇas either for the sake of heaven, or for the sake of both; when, he has attained the title of the ‘ Brāhmaṇa ,’ this implies the accomplishment of all his purposes.
The service of the Brāhmaṇa is described as the distinctive duty of the Śūdra ; everything else that he does is fruitless for him.
They should provide out of their family, a suitable maintenance for him, after considering his own capacity, and the man’s skill and the burden of persons to be supported by him.
Remnants of food and worn-out clothes shall be given to him; as also the grain-refuse and old furniture.
For the Śūdra there is no sin; nor is he worthy of any sacraments; he is not entitled to any sacred rites; but there is no prohibition against sacred rites.
If those who, knowing their duty, and wishing to acquire merit, imitate the practices of righteous men, with the exception of reciting the sacred texts, they incur no guilt; they obtain praise.
As the Śūdra , free from envy, maintains the right course of conduct, so does he, free from blame, gain this world and the next.
Even though he be able, the Śūdra shall not amass wealth; for having acquired wealth, the Śūdra harasses the Brāhmaṇas .
The duties or the four castes in times or distress have thus been expounded; by properly carrying out which they attain the highest state.
Thus has the entire law relating to the duties or the four castes been described; after this I am going to expound the excellent law relating to Expiatory Rites.
He who is seeking for progeny, he who is going to perform a sacrifice, a traveller on the road, he who has given away all his belongings, he who is begging for his preceptor, he who is begging for his parents, he who is begging for study, a sick man;—these nine Brāhmaṇas , who are religious mendicants, one should know as ‘ Snātakas ’; to these penniless men gifts shall be given, in proportion to their learning.
For these best of twice-born men, the ‘gift’ shall consist of food accompanied by a present; for others, ‘gift’ has been declared to be the cooked food given outside the sacrificial enclosure.
On Brāhmaṇas learned in the veda, the king shall bestow, according to their desert, all kinds of jewels, as also presents for sacrificial performances.
If a man, having already got a wife, weds another wife, after having begged (for the requisite wealth), sexual enjoyment is his only fruit; the issue belongs to the person who gave him the wealth.
Note: the following is an alternate translation by George Buhler :
If a man possesses food sufficient for the maintenance of those whom he has to support, for three years, or more, he deserves to drink soma.
For this reason, if a twice-born person possessing less wealth drinks Soma, he does not obtain its reward, even though he may have drunk Soma formerly.
If a wealthy man gives to other people, while his own people are living in distress,—such counterfeit virtue would be like swallowing poison, which is sweet in the beginning.
If a man does anything for his own benefit after death, to the detriment of the persons he has got to maintain,—it becomes conducive to unhappy results while he lives as also when he dies. Aged parents, well-behaved wife and infant sons have been declared by Manu to be persons that should be maintained, even by doing a hundred evil acts.
During the reign of a righteous king, if the sacrificial rite of a sacrificer, specially of a Brāhmaṇa , be interrupted for want of one requisite,—that substance may be appropriated, for the completion of that sacrifice, from the house of a Vaiśya possessed of many cattle, who does not perform sacrifices and does not drink the Soma.—(11-12)
Or, he may freely take away two or three things from the house of a Śūdra ; for the Śūdra has nothing to do with acrifices.
If a man, possessing a hundred cows, has not laid the Fire,—or a man possessing a thousand cows, performs no sacrifices,—out of the houses of these men also, one may take away (the sacrificial requisites) without hesitation.
He shall take it also from one who always acquires, and never gives, if he refuses to give up the thing; thus does his fame spread and merit increase.
Likewise one who has not eaten six meals, may, for the seventh meal, take from a person whose sacred duties are neglected,—but only to this extent that it does not last till the morrow; either from the threshing yard, or from the field, or from the house, or from any place where it may be got; but if the owner questions him, he must confess it to the questioner.
The Kṣatriya shall never appropriate the property of a Brāhmaṇa ; when starving, he may appropriate the property of the robbers and of one who neglects his duties.
He who takes wealth from the wicked and gives it to the virtuous, makes himself a raft and carries both over.
The property of persons given to perform sacrifices the learned regard as ‘the property of the gods;’ while the property of those who do not perform sacrifices is described as ‘the property of demons.’
The righteous king shall inflict no punishment upon him; as it is only through the foolishness of the Kṣatriya that the Brāhmaṇa suffers from hunger.
Having ascertained the number of persons he has to maintain, and having investigated his learning and character, the king shall provide, out of his own property, a proper living for him.
Having provided a living for him, the king shall protect him in every way; since he obtains, from the person thus protected, the sixth part of his spiritual merit.
The Brāhmaṇa shall never beg from a Śūdra wealth for the purpose of sacrificial performances; if one perform sacrifices with wealth so begged, he is born, after death, as a Caṇḍāla .
If a Brāhmaṇa , having begged wealth for a sacrifice, does not spend the whole of it, he becomes, for a hundred years, a Bhāsa or acrow.
The sinful man who, through covetousness, seizes the property of the gods, or the property of Brāhmaṇas , lives, in the other world, upon the leavings of vultures.
In the event of the impossibility of the performance of the prescribed Animal and Soma sacrifices, one shall always offer the Vaiśvānarī sacrifice at the change of the year,—in expiation thereof.
If a twice-born person performs, even in normal times, a sacred act according to the mode sanctioned for Abnormal Times,—he does not obtain its reward. Such is the well-considered opinion.
The substitute of the Primary Rule was ordained by the Viśvedevas , the Sādhyas and the great Brāhmaṇa Sages, when they were afraid of perishing in abnormal times.
If one, who is able to fulfil the primary rule, adopts the substitute,—this evil-minded man does not obtain its reward in the other world.
The Brāhmaṇa conversant with the Law shall not complain to the King; by his own power alone he shall punish the men that injure him.
His own power is more forcible than the King’s power; the twice-born man shall, therefore, punish his enemies by his own power.
He should make use of the sacred texts of the Atharva-Veda, without hesitation. Speech indeed is the Brāhmaṇa’s weapon; by that should the twice-born strike his enemies.
The Kṣatriya shall cut through his misfortunes by the strength of his arms; the Vaiśya and the Śūdra by their wealth, and the chief of the twice-born by muttered prayers and oblations into the fire.
The Brāhmaṇa is called the creator, the punisher, the teacher and the advisor; therefore one should not address unpleasant words to him, nor use any harsh words.
Neither a girl, nor a youthful woman, nor a man of little learning, nor a fool, nor one distressed, nor one without the sacraments shall act as a ‘ Hotṛ ’ at the Agnihotra.
If these persons pour the oblations, they sink into hell, as also the person to whom the agnihotra belongs; hence the ‘ Hotṛ ’ shall be a person fully learned in the Veda and expert in rituals.
If a Brāhmaṇa , possessed of wealth, does not give a ‘ prājāpatya ’ horse as the ‘fee’ foe the fire-laying, he becomes as good as one who has not laid the fire at all.
The man who has faith and control over his senses may perform other meritorious acts; but he shall not, on any account, perform sacrifices with small fees.
A sacrifice with small fees destroys the organs, honour, heaven, longevity, fame, offspring and cattle. Hence one possessed of small means shall not perform sacrifices.
If a Brāhmaṇa who has set up the fires neglects them wilfully, he shall perform the ‘ Cāndrāyaṇa ’ penance for a month; as his offence is equal to the offence of killing a hero.
It was by reason or their prolonged twilight-devotions that the sages obtained long life, wisdom, fame, refutation and Brahmic glory.
Those who perform the Agnihotra, after having obtained wealth from a Śūdra , are ‘ Śūdra’s Priests,’ censured among Vedic scholars.
The giver shall cut across his miseries by putting his foot upon the heads of those fools who attend upon the Śūdra’s fires.
If a man does not do what is enjoined, or does what is censured, or becomes addicted to sensual objects, he becomes liable to expiatory rites.
The learned understand Expiatory rites to pertain to cases where the sin is committed unintentionally; some people however assert on the evidence of ‘Śruti texts’ that they apply to cases of intentional offence also.
A sin committed unintentionally is expiated by the reciting of the Veda; while that committed intentionally, in folly, is expiated by the various forms of expiatory rites.
Having incurred the liability to an expiatory rite,—either by chance or by a previous deed,—a twice-born person shall not associate with righteous men, so long as the expiatory rite has not been performed.
Evil-minded men suffer disfigurement,—some from evil deeds committed during the present life and others from those committed in former lives.
The stealer of gold has disfigured nails; the drinker of wine, black teeth; the slayer of a Brāhmaṇa , consumption; and the violator of his preceptor’s bed, a disfigured skin; the informer, a foul-smelling nose; the false caluminator, a foul-smelling mouth; the stealer of grains, a deficiency of limbs; and the adulterator, an excess of limbs; the stealer of food, dyspepsia; the stealer of words, dumbness; the stealer of clothes, leucoderma; and the stealer of horse, lameness. It is thus that idiots, the dumb, the blind, the deaf and deformed men, despised by righteous men, are born, on account of particular acts.
Because persons with sins unexpiated are born with disgraceful marks, therefore expiatory rites shall always be performed, for the purpose of purification.
Brāhmaṇa -slaying, wine-drinking, theft, intercourse with the Preceptor’s wife,—are called the ‘heinous offences,’ as also association with these.
Lying for self-aggrandisement, caluminating before the king, and falsely harassing the Preceptor are equal to ‘ Brāhmaṇa -killing.’
Neglecting the Veda, reviling the Veda, bearing false witness, slaying a friend, and eating of forbidden and unfit food,—these six are equal to ‘wine-drinking.’
Stealing of a deposit, or of men, horse, silver, land, diamonds and other oems,—all this has been declared to be equal to the ‘stealing of gold.’
Carnal intercourse with one’s uterine sister, or with virgins, or with low-born women, or with the women of one’s friend or son,—all this they regard as equal to the ‘violating of the Preceptor’s bed.’
Killing a cow, sacrificing for one unworthy to sacrifice, adultery, selling oneself, abandoning one’s father, mother, teacher, or son, or of Vedic study or Fire;
Allowing oneself to be superseded in marriage by his younger brother, superseding by the younger one’s elder brother in marriage, and the giving of one’s daughter to, or sacrificing for, these two;
Defiling a maiden, usury, breaking of a vow, selling a tank, a garden, one’s wife or a child.
Apostacy, abandoning a relative, teaching for wages, learning from a paid teacher and the selling of what should not be sold.
Superintending all mines, executing large mechanical works, destroying medicinal herbs, subsisting on women, performing malevolent rites and sorcery.
Cutting down green trees for purposes of fuel, the undertaking of the act (of cooking) for one’s own benefit and the eating of forbidden food.
Omission of fire-laying, theft, non-payment of debts, studying bad books, and the practising of the histrionic art.
Stealing grain, base metals and cattle,—intercourse with women addicted to drinking wine,—killing women, Śūdras , Vaiśyas and Kṣatriyas ,—and heresy,—everyone of these is a ‘minor offence.’
Causing pain to a Brāhmaṇa ,—smelling at things that should not be smelt, or at wine,—cheating—and sexual intercourse with a man,—all this is declared to lead to loss of caste.
The killing of an ass, of a horse, of a camel, of a deer, of an elephant, of a goat, of a sheep, of fish, of a snake, and of a buffalo should be regarded as degrading the man to the rank of a ‘mixed caste.’
Accepting gifts from despicable persons, trading, serving Śūdras and the telling of a lie should be regarded as rendering one unworthy of receiving gifts.
The killing of insects, worms and birds,—the eating of things touched by wine,—the stealing of fruits, fuel or flowers—and inconstancy—are conducive to impurity.
Learn properly now those penances b y which all these offences, severally described, become expiated.
The Brāhmaṇa- slayer shall, for his purification, build a hut in the forest, live there for twelve years, subsisting on alms; making for himself a flag consisting of the head of the dead man.
Or, by his own will, he should become the target of armed men cognisant (of his purpose); or he may thrice throw himself headlong into blazing fire.
Or, he may offer the Aśvamedha , or the Svajit—the Gosava, or the Abhijit—Viśvajit, or the triple Agniṣṭut .
Or, for the purpose of expiating Brāhmaṇa -slay ing, he shall walk eight hundred miles, reciting one of the Vedas, eating little and controlling his senses.
He shall make over to a Brāhmaṇa learned in the Veda, his entire property, which should be wealth sufficient for his maintenance,—or a house along with the furniture.
Or, subsisting on ‘sacrificial food,’ he may walk along each stream of the Sarasvatī ; or with food restrained, he may thrice recite the text of the Veda
Having shaved off, he may dwell at the extremity of the village, or in a cow-pen, or in a hermitage under a tree,—giving himself up to doing good to cows and Brāhmaṇas .
He may give up his life unhesitatingly for the sake of a cow or a Brāhmaṇa ; the protector of the cow and the Brāhmaṇa becomes absolved from the guilt of Brāhmaṇa-killing .
If he fights at least thrice on behalf of a Brāhmaṇa , or reconquers his entire property, or gives up his life for his sake,—he becomes absolved.
He who remains thus firm in his vow, always chaste and with concentrated mind, shakes off the sin of Brāhmaṇa -slaying, on the completion of the twelfth year.
Or, having confessed his guilt before the congregation of the gods of Earth and the gods of men, if he bathes at the Final Bath of the Horse-sacrifice,—he becomes absolved.
The Brāhmaṇa is called the root of righteousness, and the Kṣatriya its top; hence one who confesses his guilt before their congregation becomes pure.
By his very birth the Brāhmaṇa is a divinity even for the gods, and an authority for the people; and the Veda itself is the cause of this.
If even three of them, learned in the Veda, expound the expiation for the offences, that shall suffice for their purification; as the word of learned men is purificatory.
A Brāhmaṇa who, with concentrated mind, follows any one of these methods, removes, on account of his being self-possessed, the sin committed by killing a Brāhmaṇa .
Having killed an unknown embryo, one should perform this same penance,—also on killing a Kṣatriya or a Vaiśya, who has performed sacrifices, or a woman of the ‘ Ātreyī ’ race.
Similarly also for telling a lie in giving evidence, for angering the preceptor, for misappropriating a trust, and for killing one’s wife or friend.
All this expiation has been laid down for killing a Brāhmaṇa unintentionally; for killing a Brāhmaṇa intentionally no atonement has been ordained.
A twice-born person, having, through folly, drunk wine, shall drink wine red-hot; he becomes freed from his guilt, when his body has been completely burnt by it.
Or, he may drink red-hot cow’s urine, or water, or milk, or butter, or liquid cow-dung, until he dies.
Or, for the expiation of the guilt of wine-drinking, he may, for one year, eat only once at night either pieces of grain or oil-cake, clothed in hair-cloth, with his hair matted, and carrying a sign.
Wine indeed is the dirty refuse of grains, and sin also is called ‘dirt’; for this reason the Brāhmaṇa , the Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya shall not drink wine.
Wine should be understood to be of three kinds: ( a ) distilled from molasses ( Gauḍī ), ( b ) distilled from grains ( Paiṣṭī ), and ( c ) ‘distilled from grapes’ ( Mādhvī ); as the one so all the rest should never be drunk by the chief of the twice-born.
Intoxicants, meat, wine and distilled liquors are the food of Yakṣas , Rākṣasas and Piśācas ; it should not be taken by the Brāhmaṇa who partakes of the offerings to the gods.
A Brāhmaṇa , stupefied by drunkenness, might tumble down upon unclean things; or he might wrongly recite the Veda; or he might do some other improper act.
When the ‘ Brahman ’ resident in his body has been once deluged by wine, the ‘ Brāhmaṇahood ’ disappears and the man becomes a Śūdra .
Thus have been described the various expiations for wine-drinking; after this I am going to expound the expiation for the theft of gold.
A Brāhmaṇa who has committed the theft of gold shall go to the King, and confessing his crime, shall say ‘sire, punish me.’
Taking up a club, the King himself shall strike him once. The thief becomes purified by death; but the Brāhmaṇa by penance alone.
If a twice-born person is desirous of removing the guilt of stealing gold by means of penance, he should perform the penance prescribed for the slayer of a Brāhmaṇa ,—living in a forest, clothed in rags.
The twice-born man shall remove the guilt caused by theft by means of these penances. That caused by intercourse with the Preceptor’s wife he shall wipe off by means of these following penances.
He who has violated his Preceptor’s bed shall confess his crime and lie down upon a heated iron-bed; or embrace a blazing image. By death he becomes purified.
Or, having cut off his penis and testicles, he shall take them in his joined hands and walk straight on towards the ‘region of evil spirits,’ until he falls down.
Or, carrying a bedstead, clothed in rags, with beard grown, he shall perform, in the solitary forest, the ‘ Prājāpatya ’ penance, for one year, with concentrated mind.
Or, with his senses controlled, he shall perform the ‘ Cāndrāyaṇa ’ for three months, subsisting on ‘sacrificial food’ or on barley-gruel,—for the expiating of the sin of violating the Preceptor’s bed.
By means of these penances, the committers of heinous crimes may wipe off their sins. The committers of minor offences may do the same by their following the several forms of penances.
The cow-killer, charged with a minor offence, shall drink barley for three months; and having shaved his head and covered with the skin of the cow, he shall live in the cow-pen.
For two months, with senses controlled, he shall eat a limited quantity of food, without any pungent salt, at the fourth meal-time; and shall bathe in cow’s urine.
During the day he shall follow those cows, and standing upright, inhale the dust; at night having attended and bowed to them, he shall rest in the ‘ Vīrāsana ’ posture.
Self-controlled and free from greed, he shall stand when they stand, follow them when they move, and sit when they have sat down.
When a cow is sick, or threatened with danger from thieves, tigers and the like, or falls, or becomes stuck in a morass, he shall rescue her with all his strength.
In heat, in rain, in cold, or when the wind is blowing violently, he shall not shelter himself, without having sheltered the cows to the best of his ability.
If the cow is eating anything in his own or another’s house, field or threshing-yard,—or when her calf is drinking (her milk),—he shall not say anything.
The cow-killer, who attends upon cows in this manner, wipes off, in three months, the sin accruing from the killing of a cow; and after having duly performed the penance, he shall give away cows with a bull as the eleventh; in the event of these being not available, he shall offer all he possesses to persons learned in the Veda.
Twice-born men who have committed the minor offences, except the ‘immoral’ religious student, may, in order to purify themselves, perform this same penance, or the ‘ Cāndrāyaṇa ’ penance.
The immoral religious student shall offer, at night, to Nirṛti , on the crossway, a one-eyed ass, in the manner of the ‘ Pākayajña .’
Having, in due form, poured oblations into the fire, he shall finally pour oblations of clarified butter to Vāta , Indra , Guru and Vahni, with the verse ‘sam, etc.’
Persons learned in the Veda and knowing the law declare that for the twice-born person keeping up his vows, the intentional emission of semen means a ‘transgression of the vow.’
The spiritual power of the Religious Student, who has become ‘immoral,’ ‘goes away into the maruts, indra, Bṛhaspati and agni.
On this sin having been incurred, the man, clothed in the skin of the ass, shall go begging alms at seven houses; proclaiming his own deed.
Subsisting on a single meal per day out of the alms obtained from those houses, and bathing at the three ‘extractions,’ he becomes pure after one year.
On having intention ally done any one of those acts which cause loss of caste, one should perform a Sāntapana-Kṛcchra ; and the Prājāpatya , when it is done unintentionally.
In the case of acts conducive to the degradation of ‘caste-mixture,’ or of those that make one unworthy of receiving gifts, purification is secured by the monthly lunar penance; and in the case of those that lead to defilement, one should mortify his body on barley-products for three days.
One fourth of the expiation for the killing of a Brāhmaṇa has been prescribed for the killing of a Kṣatriya , one eighth for that of a Vaiśya , and one sixteenth for that of a Śūdra ,—each of these being one who is devoted to his duty.
If the chief of twice-born men kills a Kṣatriya unintentionally, he should duly perform the penance and give away a thousand cows and a bull.
Or, he may perform, for three years, the penance of the ‘ Brāhmaṇa -killer,’ keeping himself under control and wearing matted locks, living far off from the village, having his abode at the root of a tree.
If a Brāhmaṇa kills a righteous Vaiśya, he shall perform this same expiatory rite for one year; or he may give a hundred cows and one (bull).
He who kills a Śūdra shall perform this same entire penance for six months; or he shall give to the Brāhmaṇa ten white cows and one bull.
Having killed a cat, an ichneumon, a blue jay, a frog, a dog, an iguana, an owl and a crow,—he shall perform the penance of the ‘ Śūdra- killer.’
Or, he may drink milk only for three days, or walk over eight hundred miles of road, or bathe in a stream, or recite the hymn addressed to the Waters.
For killing a snake, the Brāhmaṇa should give an iron spade; and in the case of a eunuch, a load of straw and a ‘ māsa ’ of lead.
For a boar, a jar of clarified butter; for a partridge, a ‘ droṇa ’ of sesamum; for a parrot, a two-year-old calf; and for killing a horse, a three-year-old calf.
On having killed a swan, a balākā , a crane, a peacock, a monkey, a falcon, or a vulture,—one should give a cow to a Brāhmaṇa .
On killing a horse, one should give a garment; and five black bulls on killing an elephant; on killing a goat and a sheep, an ox; and on killing a hare, a one-year-old calf.
For killing carnivorous animals, one should give a milch-cow; and a heifer for killing those not carnivorous; and a ‘ kṛṣṇala ’ of gold for killing a camel.
For killing inconstant women of the four castes, one should give, for his purification, a leathern bag, a bow, a goat and a sheep respectively.
If a twice-born person is unable to atone the sin of killing by means of gifts, he should perform the ‘ Kṛcchra ,’ for each act, for the purpose of removing his sin.
If one kills one thousand animals ‘with bones,’ or a full cart-load of boneless ones, he shall perform the penance for the killing of a Śūdra .
For the killing of animals with bones, he should give some trifle to a Brāhmaṇa ; and for the killing of boneless animals, one becomes purified by the ‘control of breath.’
When one cuts fruit-bearing trees, shrubs, creepers, branches of trees or flowering plants, he should recite one hundred Ṛk verses.
For the destroying of any kind of creatures bred in food, in sauces, in fruits or in flowers, the expiation consists in eating with clarified butter.
If one needlessly cuts plants grown by cultivation, or those that spontaneously grow in the forest, he shall attend on the cow for one day, subsisting on milk only.
By means of these penances shall one remove the six arising from the act of slaying, either intentionally or unintentionally. Now listen to all that is involved in eating forbidden food.
If one drinks wine unintentionally, he becomes pure by a sacrament; this, however, is not what should be prescribed in the case of doing the act intentionally; in which case there should be a penance involving death;—such is the settled law.
If one has drunk water kept in a vessel used for keeping wine, or in a pot where intoxicating drinks are kept, he shall drink, for five days, milk in which Śaṅkhapuṣpī has been boiled.
If one touches wine, or offers it to another, or receives it in due form,—or if he drinks water left by a Śūdra ,—he shall drink kuśa-water for three days.
If a Brāhmaṇa who has partaken of the Soma inhales the odour given out by a wine-drinker, he becomes pure by thrice suppressing his breath in water and eating clarified butter.
The three twice-born castes, who have unwittingly swallowed ordure or urine, or anything that has been in contact with wine, are liable to re-initiation.
In the performance of the Re-initiation of twice-born men, tonsure, the girdle, the staff, begging alms, and the vows are omitted.
If one has eaten the food of persons of unfit food, or food left by a woman or a Śūdra ,—or forbidden flesh,—he shall drink barley for seven days.
If a twice-born person drinks soured liquids or decoctions,—even though they be pure,—remains impure until it has gone down.
If a twice-born person swallows the ordure or urine of the village-pig, of an ass, of a camel, of a jackal, of a monkey, or of a crow—he shall perform the Cāndrāyaṇa .
If one eats dried meat, mushrooms growing on the ground, or unrecognised meat lying in the slaughter-house—he shall perform this same penance.
For eating the meat of carnivorous animals, of pigs, of camels, of cocks, of crows, of asses, or of human flesh,—the atonement consists of the Tapta-Kṛcchra .
If a twice-born person, who has not completed his course of study, eats food given at a monthly rite, he shall fast for three days and remain one day in water.
If a person keeping a vow happens, in any way, to eat honey or meat, he should perform the original Kṛcchra , and then complete the remainder of his vow.
He who eats what has been left by a cat, a crow, a rat, a dog, or an ichneumon,—or food defiled by a hair or an insect,—shall drink the Brahmasuvarcalā herb.
If one desires his own purity, he should not eat improper food; when eaten unintentionally, it should be thrown out, or speedily atoned for by means of purifications.
Thus has the law relating to the penances for the eating of improper food been set forth; listen now to the law relating to the penances expiatory of the sins of theft.
If a chief of twice-born men intentionally commits theft of grains, cooked food and wealth, from the house of a caste-fellow, he becomes pure by performing the Kṛcchra for one year.
For the stealing of men and women, of a field or a house, or the water of a well, or a tank,—the Cāndrāyaṇa has been declared to be the expiation.
If one steals things of small value in the house of another, he should restore them; and for his own purification, he should perform the ‘ Sāntapana Kṛcchra .’
For the stealing of eatables and edibles, of a conveyance or a bed, or a seat, or of fruits, roots and flowers,—the expiation consists of the Five Products of the cow.
There should be fasting for three days, in the case of stealing grass, wood, trees, dry food, molasses, clothes, leather and meat.
In the case of the stealing of gems, pearls, corals, copper, silver, iron, bronze and stone, one should subsist, for twelve days, on pieces of grain.
In the case of cotton, silk, wool, an animal with cleft hoofs, an animal with uncleft hoofs, a bird, perfumes, medicinal herbs, and a rope,—milk shall be drunk for three days.
By means of these penances, the twice-born man shall remove the sin caused by theft; that due to approaching women who should not be approached, he shall expiate by these (following) penances.
If one has had sexual intercourse with his uterine sister, or with the wife of his friend, or of his son, or with an unmarried maiden, or with a lowest-born woman,—he should perform the penance prescribed for the ‘violation of the Preceptor’s Bed.’
On having had intercourse with one’s sister born of his father’s sister, or of his mother’s sister, or of his mother’s full brother,—one should perform the Cāndrāyaṇa .
A wise man should never take these three as his wife; being blood-relations, they are not fit to be married; because by marrying them one sinks low.
A man who has had sexual intercourse with nonhuman females, or with a menstruating woman,—and he who has discharged his semen in a place other than the female organ, or in water,—should perporm the ‘ Sāntapana K ṛcchra .’
If a twice-born man commits an unnatural offence with a male, or has intercourse with a female, in an ox-cart, or in water, or during the day,—he should take a bath along with his clothes.
If a Brāhmaṇa unintentionally approaches a woman of the Caṇḍāla or other lowest-born castes,—or eats her food, or receives her presents,—he becomes an outcast; but if he does it intentionally, he becomes her equal.
If the wife is particularly corrupt, her husband should keep her confined in one room, and should make her perform that penance which has been prescribed for males in cases of adultery.
If she happens to be corrupted again, on being solicited by a man of equal caste,—then the Kṛcchra and the Cāndrāyaṇa would be the means prescribed for her purification.
What a twice-born man commits by dallying with a Caṇḍālī for one night,—that he wipes off in three years, living on alms and constantly repeating (sacred texts).
Thus has the atonement tor the four kinds of sinners been set forth; now listen to these (following) expiations for those who associate with outcasts.
If one associates with an outcast for one year, he himself becomes an outcast; not by sacrificing for him, or teaching him, or forming a matrimonial alliance with him,—but by walking, sitting or eating.
When a man associates with any one of outcasts, he should, for his own purification, perform the same penance that has been prescribed for that outcast.
When one has become an outcast, his Sapiṇḍas and relations shall offer him ‘water’ outside, on an inauspicious day, in the evening, in the presence of relatives, priests and elders.
A female slave shall overturn a jar full of water with her foot, as in the case of the dead; and they, along with the relations, shall observe the ‘uncleanliness’ for the day and night.
Thenceforth shall cease all conversation with him, sitting with him, his sharing in property, as also all ordinary intercourse.
The right of primogeniture shall be withheld, as also the additional share of property due to the eldest; the additional share due to him as the eldest shall be obtained by his younger brother, who is superior to him in quality.
If however the expiation has been performed, they shall bathe with him in a sacred reservoir of water and shall throw into the water a fresh jar filled with water.
Having thrown that jar into the water, he shall enter his own house and carry on, as before, all his family-functions.
This same method is to be adopted also in the case of female outcasts; but clothing, food and drink shall be supplied to them and they shall live close to the house.
One shall not carry on any business with unexpiated sinners; but in no case shall he despise those who have performed the expiation.
One shall not associate with murderers of children, ungrateful men, murderers of a refugee, and murderers of women,—even though they may have been duly purified.
Though twice-born men to whom the Sāvitrī has not been taught according to rule, should be made to perform three Kṛcchra penances and then initiated in due form.
When twice-born men, who follow improper occupations, or who are abandoned by the Veda, are desirous of performing expiations—for these also this same expiation is to be prescribed.
When Brāhmaṇas acquire property by an objectionable act, they become pure by giving it up, and also by repeating sacred texts and performing austerities.
Having, with concentrated mind, repeated the Sāvitrī three thousand times, and drinking milk in a cow-pen for one month, he becomes absolved from the sin of accepting an improper gift.
When he has returned from the cow-pen, emaciated with the fast, and humble, they shall ask him—‘friend, dost thou desire equality with us?’
Having said ‘Forsooth’ to the Brāhmaṇas , he shall scatter grass to the cows; whereupon they shall accord admission to him at a place hallowed by the cows.
If one sacrifices for apostates, or performs the obsequies of strangers, or malevolent rites, or the Ahīna sacrifice,—he wipes it off by three Kṛcchras .
If a twice-born man has abandoned a refugee, or has tampered with the Veda, he atones for that offence by living upon barley for one year.
When bitten by a dog, or a jackal, or an ass, or by a tame carnivorous animal, or by a man, or a camel, or a pig—he becomes pure by ‘breath-suppression.’
For persons excommunicated from repasts, the purification consists in ( a ) eating at the sixth meal-time, reciting the Vedic text, and the daily offering of the ‘ Sākala homa ,’ for a month.
If a Brāhmaṇa intentionally hides a conveyance drawn by a camel, or one drawn by asses,—or if he bathes naked,—he becomes pure by ‘breath-suppression.’
If, on being pressed, one passes bodily refuse, either without water, or in water, he becomes pure by bathing in his clothes, outside and touching a cow.
For the neglect of the compulsory duties laid down by the Veda, and for the omission of the observances of the Accomplished Student,—the expiation is fasting.
If a man has uttered the syllable ‘hum’ against a Brāhmaṇa , or has addressed a superior person as ‘thou,’—he shall bathe, fast for the rest of the day and having saluted him, shall propitiate him.
Having struck him even with a blade of grass, or having tied him in the neck with a cloth, or having defeated him in an altercation,—one shall bow to him and appease him.
If, with the intention of injuring a Brāhmaṇa , one has threatened him, he shall remain in hell for a hundred years; and for one thousand years, if he has struck him.
As many particles of dust on the ground as Brāhmaṇa’s blood coagulates, for so many thousand years will the shedder (of that blood lie in hell.
On threatening a Brāhmaṇa , one shall perform the Kṛcchra ; on striking him, the Atikṛcchara , and on shedding his blood, both the Kṛcchra and the Atikṛcchra .—
For the atonement of offences for which no expiation has been prescribed, one should fix an expiation after taking into consideration the man’s capacity and the nature of the offence.
I am now going to describe to you those methods, adopted by gods and sages and Pitṛs , by means of which a man may wipe off his sins.
The twice-born, who is performing the Prājāpatya , shall eat in the morning for three days, then in the evening for three days, then for three days food got unasked, and for the next three days he shall not eat.
Taking cow’s urine, cow-dung, milk, curds, clarified butter, kuśa-water, and fasting for one day,—has been declared to be ‘ Sāntapana Kṛcchra ’—
The twice-born man who is performing the ‘ Atikṛcchra ’ shall eat only one mouthful at each of the three times mentioned above, for three days,—and shall fast during the last three days.
The Brāhmaṇa who is performing the ‘ Tapta-Kṛcchra ’ shall drink hot water, hot milk, hot clarified butter and hot air,—each for three days; bathing once and having his mind concentrated.
If a man, self-controlled and guarded, fasts for twelve days,—this constitutes the ‘ Kṛcchra ’ name ‘ Parāka ’, which removes all sins.
If one reduces his food by one morsel daily during the dark half of the month, and increases it during the light half,—bathing at the three ‘extractions,’—it is what has been called the ‘ Cāndrāyaṇa .’
This same method shall be adopted in the ‘Yavamadhyama’ penance, but beginning it in the bright half of the month; and it is with a controlled mind that one should perform the ‘ Cāndrāyaṇa ’ penance.
One who performs the ‘ Yati-Cāndrāyaṇa ’ shall eat daily at midday eight morsels, controlling himself and eating only ‘sacrificial food.’
The Brāhmaṇa , with concentrated mind, shall eat four morsels in the morning, and four when the sun has set this is called the ‘ Śiśu-Cāndrāyaṇa .’
If a man, with concentrated mind, somehow eats thrice eighty morsels of ‘sacrificial food,’ during a month, he attains the regions of the Moon.
The Rudras, Ādityas and the Maruts, along with the Great Sages, have performed this penance, for deliverance from all evils.
Homa-offerings shall be made by the man himself everyday, with the ‘ Mahāvyāhṛtis ,’ and he should practise harmlessness, truthfulness, freedom from anger, and mercy.
Thrice in the day and thrice in the night shall he enter water along with his clothes; and he shall never converse with women, Śūdras and outcasts.
He shall pass his time standing and sitting; or if he is unable to do so, he may lie down on the ground ; he shall remain chaste, firm in vows, worshipping his elders, gods and Brāhmaṇas .
He shall constantly repeat the Sāvitrī , as also other purificatory texts, to the best of his ability. This shall be done with due care, in connection with all penances performed for the sake of expiation.
By means of these penances are those twice-born persons to be purified whose sins have become known; those whose sins have not become known, one shall purify by means of sacred texts and Homa-offerings.
By confession, by repentance, by austerity and by study is the sinner freed from sin; as also by gifts in cases of difficulty.
As a man, having committed a misdeed, goes on proclaiming it himself, so does he become freed from that sin, as a snake from its slough.
As his mind goes on loathing the evil deed, so is his body freed from that sin.
After having committed, a sin, if one repents, he becomes freed from that sin; he becomes purified by the renunciation—‘I shall not do so again.’
Having thus considered in his mind the results arising after death from his deeds, he should perform good acts, by his thought, speech and body.
Either intentionally or unintentionally, if one has done a reprehensible act, he must not do it a second time, if he seeks absolution from the former.
If in regard to any act that has been committed, his mind be uneasy, he shall perform the penance prescribed for it until it brings peace to his mind.
All happiness among gods and men has been declared by the wise ones to whom the Veda was revealed to have austerity for its source, austerity for its middle and austerity for its end.
The ‘austerity’ for the Brāhmaṇa is ‘knowledge’; the ‘austerity’ for the Kṣatriya is ‘protecting’; the ‘austerity’ for the Vaiśya is ‘agriculture’; and the ‘austertty’ for the Śūdra is ‘service.’
It is by austerity alone that self-controlled sages, subsisting on fruits, roots and air, survey the three worlds, including all moveable and immoveable beings.
Medicines, drugs, science and the various kinds of divine condition are acquired by austerity; as austerity is the means of their accomplishment.
What is hard to traverse, what is hard to attain, what is hard to reach, and what is hard to do,—all this is accomplished by Austerity; as Austerity is irrepressible.
Those who have committed heinous offences, as also those who have committed other misdeeds, become freed from their sins by means of austerities well-performed.
Insects, snakes, moths, animals and birds, as also immovable beings go to heaven by the force of austerities.
Whatever sin people commit by thought, word or deed,—all that they speedily burn away, having Austerity as their sole wealth.
It is only when the Brāhmaṇa has been purified by Austerities that Heavenly Beings accept their sacrifices and advance their interests.
It was by means of Austerity that Lord Prajāpati gave forth these ordinances; and it was by means of Austerity that the Sages obtained the Vedas.
The gods, discerning that the holy origin of all this lies in austerity, thus proclaim the magnificence of Austerity.
The daily recitation of the Veda, to the best of one’s ability, the ‘Great Sacrifices,’ and ‘tolerance,’ quickly destroy all sins,—even those due to heinous offences.
Just as fire, in a moment, consumes with its heat the fuel placed upon it, so does the man learned in the Veda destroy all sins by the fire of knowledge.
The due expiation of sins has thus been described; listen after this to the expiation of secret sins.
Sixteen ‘Breath-Suppressions’ with the Vyāhṛtis and the Praṇava , performed daily, purify, in a month, even the ‘murderer of the embryo’ ( Brāhmaṇa ).
Even a drinker of wine becomes pure if he recites the ‘Kautsa hymn,’ beginning with the term ‘Ap,’ or the ‘ Vāsiṣṭha hymn,’ consisting of the triad of verses beginning with ‘Prati,’ or the ‘ Māhitra hymn,’ or the ‘Śuddhavati verses.’
Having stolen gold, one instantly becomes free from impurity, by reciting once the ‘ Āsyavāmīya hymn’ and the ‘ Śivasaṅkalpa hymn.’
The Violator of the Preceptor’s Bed becomes absolved by repeating the ‘ Haviṣpāntīya Hymn,’ ( Ṛgveda , 10.88.1), the verse beginning with ‘na tamam ha’ ( Ṛgveda , 10.126) and that beginning with ‘iti’ ( Ṛgveda , 10.119),—and by reciting the ‘ Puruṣasūkta ’ ( Ṛgveda , 10.90.1)
One who desires to expiate sins great and small, shall repeat, for one year, the verse beginning with ‘ava’, or that beginning with ‘ yatkiñcedam .’
If a man has accepted a gift that should not be accepted, or has eaten reprehensible food, he becomes pure in three days, by repeating the Taratsamandīya ’ verses.
One who has committed many sins becomes purified by reciting, for a year, the ‘ Somāraudra hymn’ and the three verses beginning with ‘ aryamaṇam ,’—while taking his bath in a stream.
An offender shall recite, for half the year, the seven verses beginning with ‘Indram’; but he who has committed a reprehensible act in water shall subsist, for one month, on alms.
A twice-born person destroys even the most grievous sin by making Homa-offerings of clarified butter for one year, with the sacred texts related to the ‘ Śākala-homa ,’ or by repeating the verse beginning with ‘ namaḥ .’
He who is polluted by a ‘heinous offence,’ should, with concentrated mind, attend upon cows; and by repeating the Pāvamānī verses and subsisting on alms for one year, he becomes pure.
Or, if, purified by the performance of three ‘ Parāka ’ penances, and self-controlled, he repeats thrice the entire text of the Veda, in a forest, he becomes absolved from all sins.
If a man fasts for, three days, and entering the water thrice a dat repeats the ‘ Aghamarṣaṇa Hymn’ three times, he becomes absolved from all sins.
Just as the Aśvamedha , the king of sacrifices, is destructive of all sins, even so is the ‘ Aghamarṣaṇa Hymn’ also destructive of all sins.
Even if he kills the three worlds, or if he eats here and there, he does not incur any sin, if he retains the Ṛgveda (in memory).
One becomes absolved from all sins by reciting, with concentrated mind, three times, the text of the Ṛk or of the Yajuṣ , or of the Sāman , along with the esoteric texts.
As a clod of earth, being thrown, becomes dissolved as soon as it gets into the water,—even so does all sin become engulfed in the threefold Veda.
The Ṛk -verses, the primeval Yajuṣ- texts, and the manifold Sāman -songs,—these constitute the ‘Threefold Veda’; he who knows this is ‘learned in the Vedas.’
That primeval tri-syllablic brahman, in which bests the Vedic Triad, is the other and esoteric ‘Threefold Veda’; he who knows this is ‘learned in the Vedas.’
‘O sinless one, the whole law for the four castes has been expounded by you; instruct us now in regard to the actual fruition of actions.’
The righteous Bhṛgu , sprung for Manu, said to the Great Sages—‘Listen to the truth regarding the relation of Actions.’
Actions proceeding from mind, speech and body are conducive to good and bad results; and the conditions of men, due to actions, are high, low and middling.
Know the mind to be the instigator of all this that is connected with the body, and which is of three kinds, has three substrata and is endowed with ten distinct characteristics.
Coveting the wealth or others, scheming in one’s mind about what is undesirable, adhering to a wrong notion,—these are the three forms of ‘mental action.’
Abusing, lying, calumniating all men, and idle prattling,—are the pour kinds of ‘verbal action.’
Taking what has not been given, unsanctioned killing, and intercourse with the wives of others—these have been declared to be three kinds of ‘bodily action.’
The good and the evil resulting from ‘mental acts,’ one experiences through the Mind alone; those of ‘verbal acts,’ through speech; and those of ‘bodily acts,’ through the body.
Through sinful acts due to the Body, man becomes inanimate; through those of Speech, a bird or a beast; and through those of Mind, he is born in the lowest caste.
Control over Speech, control over the Mind and control over the Body,—the man in whose heart these are firmly fixed is called ‘the man of triple control.’
The man who keeps this ‘triple control’ in regard to all creatures, and rightly subdues desire and anger, thereby attains success.
He who is the impeller of this body, him they call the ‘ Kṣetrajña ,’ ‘the Conscious Being’; while he who does the acts is called by the learned, the ‘ Bhūtātman ,’ ‘the Material Entity.’
An inner ‘self,’ called ‘ Jīva ,’ ‘Soul,’ is different,—generated along with all embodied beings, through which one experiences pleasure and fain during the several births.
Both of these, the ‘Great Principle’ and the ‘Conscious Being,’ united with the material substances, subsist in Him who resides in all things, pervading them all.
From his body emanate innumerable forms, which constantly energise all kinds of beings.
In the case of misbehaved persons, there is produced out of five constituents, another strong body, for the suffering of torments, after death.
After they have suffered, through this body, the torments inflicted by yama, those constituents become dissolved into each of those same material elements.
Having suffered the evils produced by attachment to sensual objects, and conducive to misery, he, having his sins destroyed, approaches those same two glorious ones.
Those two together carefully look into his merit and demerit, invested with which both, he obtains happiness or unhappiness, here and after death.
If he practises virtue for the most part, and vice only in a small degree, then, invested with those same material substances, he obtains happiness in heaven.
If on the other hand he practises vice for the most part, and virtue only in a small degree,—then, becoming deserted by those substances, he suffers the torments inflicted by Yama.
That personality, having suffered those torments inflicted by Yama, and thereby freed from sin, again enters into those very material substances, each in due proportion.
Having recognised, in his own mind, the conditions of the Personality, due to Virtue and Vice, one should fix his heart upon Virtue.
Know Sattva, Rajas and Tamas to be the three qualities of the Self, by means of which the Great One completely pervades all these beings.
Whichsoever of these qualities wholly predominates in a body, it makes the owner of that body abound in that quality.
‘Sattva’ has been declared to be Knowledge, ‘Tamas,’ to be Ignorance, and ‘Rajas,’ to be Love and Hate;—such is the nature of these, all-pervading and interpenetrating all beings.
Whenever one perceives in himself something full of bliss, calm and pure,—he should know it to be ‘Sattva.’
What is mixed with pain and brings unhappiness to the Soul,—know that to be ‘Rajas,’ imperceptible and constantly attracting embodied beings.
What is mixed with stupefaction, undiscernible, of the nature of sensual objects, incapable of being reasoned about and uncognisable,—one should recognise as ‘Tamas.’
I am now going to fully describe the results,—good, middling and bad—proceeding from these three qualities.
Vedic study, austerity, knowledge, purity, control over the organs, practice of virtue and meditation on the Soul,—are the characteristics of the quality of ‘Sattva.’
Proneness to undertake work, impatience, commission of improper acts, constant addiction to sensual objects are the characteristics of the quality of ‘Rajas.’
Avarice, drowsiness, irresolution, cruelty, disbelief, bad character, habit of begging, and inattentiveness are the characteristics of the quality of ‘Tamas.’
This should be understood to be in brief the characteristic of these three qualities in order, as they appear at the three times.
When, having done, or doing, or going to do a certain act, a man happen to feel ashamed,—every such act should be understood by the learned to be characterised by the quality of ‘Tamas.’
When, by a certain act, the man desires great fame in this world, and does not mind failure—this should be understood to partake of the quality of ‘Rajas.’
When, however, the act is one which he wishes to understand in all its details, by doing which he does not feel ashamed, and by which his heart feels satisfied,—it is characterised by the quality of ‘Sattva.’
Pleasure is the distinguishing feature of ‘Tamas,’ ‘Wealth’ is described to be that of ‘Rajas,’ and ‘Spiritual Merit’ is the distinguishing feature of ‘Sattva,’—each succeeding one of these being superior to the preceding.
I am now going to describe, briefly, in due order, those migratory states into which one falls through each quality from among these.
Those partaking of ‘Sattva’ reach the state of the gods, those endowed with ‘Rajas,’ the state of men, and those characterised by ‘Tamas,’ the state of beasts; such is the threefold migratory state.
This threefold Migratory State due to the qualities should be understood to be again of three kinds each—high, low and middling, in accordance with the peculiar character of the act and knowledge of each man.
Inanimate beings, worms, insects, fishes, snakes, tortoise, cattle and wild animals,—represent the lowest state due to the quality of ‘Tamas.’
Stick-fencers, wrestlers, actors, men subsisting by the use of weapons, those addicted to gambling and drinking,—represent the lowest state among those partaking of the quality of ‘Rajas.’
Kings, Kṣatriyas , priests of kings, and leading wranglers and warriors represent the middling state among those partaking of ‘Rajas.’
Gandharvas, Guhyakas, ‘ Yakṣas ,’ the attendants of the gods, and all the Apsaras, represent the high state among those partaking of ‘Rajas.’
Ascetics and hermits, Brāhmaṇas , celestial beings, lunar asterisms, and Daityas represent the first state partaking of ‘Sattva.’
Sacrificers, sages, gods, vedas, luminaries, years, Pitṛs and Sādhyas represent the second state partaking of ‘Sattva.’
Brahmā , creators of the universe, Dharma, the Great One, Unmanifest,—these the wise ones describe as representing the best state partaking of ‘Sattva.’
Thus has been described the entire thrice threefold migratory process pertaining to all beings, arising out of the three kinds of action.
Foolish men of the lowest class go through the vilest migratory states, in consequence of being addicted to the senses and by not attending to duties.
Into what wombs the soul enters,—and in consequence of what acts,—listen to that, in due order.
Persons who have committed the heinous offences, having passed, during several years, through dreadful hells, reach, after the expiation thereof, the following migratory states.
He who kills a Brāhmaṇa enters the womb of a dog, a pig, an ass, a camel, a cow, a goat, a sheep, a deer or a bird, or that of a Caṇḍāla or a Pukkasa.
The Brāhmaṇa who drinks wine shall enter the womb of worms, insects, moths, of birds feeding on ordure, or of carnivorous animals.
The Brāhmaṇa who steals gold shall (enter) a thousand times into the womb of the spider, the snake, the lizard, of aquatic animals or of carnivorous Piśācas .
The violator of the Preceptor’s Bed is born hundreds of times as grasses, shrubs, creepers, as carnivorous and fanged animals, or as beings of cruel deeds.
Sanguinary persons become carnivorous animals; the eaters of impure food become worms; thieves become creatures consuming their own kind; and those having intercourse with women of the lowest caste become Pretas.
He who associates with outcasts, he who approaches the wife of another person, and he who has stolen the property of a Brāhmaṇa , become ‘ Brahmarākṣasas .’
The man who, through greed, steals gems, pearls and corals, or the various kinds of precious articles, is born among ‘ Hemakartṛs .’
By stealing grains one becomes a rat; by stealing bronze, a Haṃsa; by stealing water, a Plava; by stealing honey, a gnat; by stealing milk, a crow; by stealing sweets, a dog; and by stealing clarified butter, an ichneumon.
For stealing meat, a vulture; for stealing fat, a cormorant; for stealing oil, a ‘ Tailapāyika ’ bird; for stealing salt, a Cīrīvāka ; and for stealing curds, a ‘ Balākā ’-bird.
For stealing silk, a partridge; for stealing linen, a frog; for stealing cotton-cloth, a crane; for stealing a cow, an alligator; and for stealing molasses, a ‘ Vāgguda ’-bird.
For stealing excellent perfumes, a musk-rat; for stealing vegetables with leaves, a peacock; for stealing cooked food of various kinds, a Śvāvit ; and for stealing uncooked food a hedge-hog.
For stealing fire, a heron; for stealing utensils, a ‘ Gṛhakāri ’-bird; for stealing red clothes, one is born as a ‘ Jīvajīvaka ’-bird
For stealing a deer or an elephant, a wolf; for stealing a horse, a tiger; for stealing fruits and roots, a monkey; for stealing a woman, a bear; for stealing water, a ‘Stokaka’-bird; for stealing conveyances, a camel; and for stealing cattle, a goat.
For taking by force any kind of property belonging to another, and for eating a sacrificial material that has not been offered, one inevitably becomes an animal.
For stealing things, women also should incur guilt on this same principle; they become the female of those same creatures that have been named.
If men of the various castes deviate from their occupations, under normal conditions, they migrate into vile migratory states and become servants among robbers.
The Brāhmaṇa fallen off from his own duty becomes a ‘fire-mouthed’ Preta feeding on vomitings; and the Kṣatriya a ‘foul-nosed’ Preta feeding on impure substances and dead bodies.
The Vaiśya, fallen from his duty, becomes the ‘ Maitrākṣajyotika ’ Preta feeding on pus; and the Śūdra becomes a ‘ Cailāśaka ’ Preta
In the proportion that sensually-inclined persons go on indulging in sensual pleasures, in that same proportion their ardour for them goes on increasing.
By the repetition of the said sinful acts, those men with shall understanding undergo sufferings in the various forms of existence in this world.
(They also suffer) being tossed about in the Tāmisra and other dreadful hells, and being bound and mangled in the ‘forest with sword-leaved trees’ and other places.
Also various forms of torments, being devoured by ravens and owls, tortures from morasses and scorching sand, and terrible boiling in jars.
Constant births in low forms of life, abounding in misery, afflictions from heat and cold, and terrors of various kinds.
Repeated lying in wombs, agonising births, painful bondages, and slavery to others.
Separations from relations and loved ones, dwelling with the wicked, acquiring wealth and losing it, making of friends and enemies.
With whatever disposition a man performs an act, the fruit thereof he reaps with a body of that same quality.
Thus has been indicated to you the entire manner in which results proceed from actions; now learn that act which brings about the Highest Good of the Brāhmaṇa .
Vedic Study, Austerity, Knowledge, Control of the Senses, Harmlessness, Service of Elders,—are the best means of attaining the Highest Good.
Question —“From among all these good acts, is t here any one act which has been described as more efficacious in securing to man his Highest Good?”
Among the six aforesaid actions, the performance of ‘Vedic Acts’ should be regarded as the most efficacious for bringing about happiness in this world and as well as after death.
All these are fully included, each in its turn, in a particular course of performance of the Vedic Act.
The ‘Vedic Act’ is of two kinds—( a ) the ‘active,’ which is conducive to happiness and prosperity, and ( b ) the ‘passive,’ which is conducive to the highest good.
That which is done with knowledge and brings about the fulfilment of desires either in this world, or in the next, is described as ‘active’; while that which is done with knowledge and without desires, is declared to be ‘passive.’
He who devotes himself to the ‘active’ side, attains equality to the gods; while he who devotes himself to the ‘passive’ section, passes beyond the five material substances.
He who perceives the Self in all beings, and all beings in the Self,—and sacrifices to the Self,—attains self-sovereignty.
Having renounced even the said acts, the Brāhmaṇa shall concentrate his effort on the knowledge of Self, on calmness and on the study of the Veda.
This represents the fulfilment of the object of one’s existence, specially for the Brāhmaṇa ; it is only when he has attained this, and not otherwise, that the twice-born man has accomplished his purpose.
For Pitṛs , gods and men, the Veda is the eternal eye; the teaching of the Veda is beyond power and illimitable. Such is the settled fact.
Those ‘revealed texts’ that are outside the Veda, as also all the false theories, are useless, even when carried to perfection; as they have been declared to be founded on ‘darkness.’
Those other (doctrines) which spring up and perish are all worthless and false, being of modern growth.
The four castes, the three worlds, the four life-stages, the past, the present and the future are each learnt from the Veda.
Sound, touch, colour, taste, and odour as the fifth, proceed from the Veda; their production being due to the ‘secondary rites.’
The eternal lore of the Veda upholds all beings; f or th is reason I regard this as the best means of accomplishing the ends of every creature.
It is only one who knows the Vedic lore that deserves the command over armies, Kingly authority, the office of the adjudicator of punishments and sovereignty over all men.
Just as fire, having gained strength, burns even green trees, even so does the person knowing the Veda consume all the evil effects of his deeds.
In whatever life-stage he may be, the person who knows the true meaning of the Vedic Scriptures becomes fit for union with brahman, even while dwelling in this world.
Better than ignoramuses are those who ‘read the books’; better than the ‘reader of books’ are those who ‘retain’ them; better than the ‘retainers’ are those who have ‘knowledge’; and better than those having ‘knowledge’ are those who act.
Austerity and knowledge are conducive to the Highest Good of the Brāhmaṇa ; by Austerity he destroys sins and by Knowledge he attains immortality.
If one desires to obtain the correct knowledge of Dharma, he should become fully acquainted with these three:—Perception, Inference and the Scriptures of various traditions.
If a man explores, by ratiocination, the Vedic teaching regarding Dharma, he alone, and no other, understands Dharma.
The act conducive to the Highest Good is as has been here fully declared. Now is going to be set forth the secret of the Teachings of Manu
If the question should arise—“How should it be in regard to those points upon which the laws have not been declared?”—the answer is—what the cultured Brāhmaṇas declare, that shall be the undoubted law.
Those Brāhmaṇas , by whom the Veda, along with its supplements, has been learnt in the right manner, and who are guided directly by the revealed texts,—shall be regarded as ‘cultur ed.’
When an assembly consisting of at least ten men,—or of at least three men firm in their duty,—declares a certain law, one should not seek to dispute it.
A person learned in the three Vedas, a logician, an investigator, a person knowing the Nirukta, a lawyer and three men belonging to the first three life-stages, shall constitute the ‘Assembly’; which shall consist of at least ten members.
A person knowing the Ṛgveda , a person knowing the Yajurveda, and a person knowing the Sāmaveda , shall be understood to form the assembly of at least three members, competent to decide doubtful points of law.
That which even a single Brāhmaṇa learned in the Veda decides to be the law, shall be understood to be the highest law,—and not what is asserted by ten thousand ignoramuses.
Even if thousands of Brāhmaṇas come together,—who have not fulfilled their duties, who are ignorant of the sacred texts, who subsist merely by the name of their caste,—the character of the ‘Assembly’ cannot belong to them.
When ignorant men, partaking of the quality of ‘Tamas,’ declare a certain act as right, without knowing what ‘right’ means,—the sin of that act falls hundred-fold upon those who propound it.
All that is conducive to the Highest Good has been thus expounded to you; the Brāhmaṇa who has not deviated from this, attains the highest state.
Thus has the blessed Lord explained to me, with a desire to benefit mankind, the highest secret of Dharma.
With a concentrated mind, one should perceive in the Self all things, real as well as unreal. One who perceives all things in the Self never turns his mind towards wrong.
The Self alone is all the gods; everything subsists in the Self; it is the Self that brings about the connection of these embodied beings with actions.
One should withdraw the Ākāśa into the ten cavities, the Wind into the organs of touch and movement, the best Light into the organs of digestion and vision, the Water into the fluids, and the Earth into the solid limbs.
The Moon into the mind, Space into the ear, Viṣṇu into movement, Hara into strength, Agni into speech, Mitra into the excretions, and Prajāpati into the generative organ.
The ruler of all, who is minuter than the minutest atom, bright like gold, amenable to dream-cognition,—him should one know as the Highest Puruṣa .
This some people call ‘Agni’; others, ‘Manu- Prajāpati ’; others, ‘Indra’; others, ‘ Prāṇa ’; and yet others, ‘the Eternal Brahman.’
He it is who, interpenetrating all beings, with his five forms, makes them, revolve constantly like a wheel, through birth, growth and decay.
He who thus perceives the Self through the Self, in all beings, becomes equal towards all and attains the highest state, Brahman.
The twice-born man who reads these Ordinances of Manu, shall be ever equipped with virtue and shall attain whatever state he may desire.
