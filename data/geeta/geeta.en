Dhritarashtra  said:  Sanjaya ,  gathered  on  the  sacred  soil  of  Kurukshetra ,  eager  to  fight ,  what  did  my  children  and  the  children  of  Pandu  do?
Sanjaya  said:  At  that  time ,  seeing  the  army  of  the  Pandavas  drawn  up  for  battle  and  approaching  Dronacharya  King  Duryodhana  spoke  these  words:
Behold ,  Master ,  the  mighty  army  of  the  sons  of  Pandu  arrayed  for  battle  by  your  talented  pupil ,  Dhristadyumna ,  son  of  Drupada.
The  strong  Yodhamanyu  and  the  brave  Uttamaujas ,  the  son\nof  Subhadra ,  and  the  sons  of  Draupadi ,  all  of  great  chariots
Dhrishtaketu ,  chekitana  and  the  valiant  king  of  Kasi ,  Purujit  and  Kuntibhoja  and  Saibya ,  the  best  men
the  best  of  men  and  mighty  Yudhamanyu ,  and  valiant  Uttamauja ,  Abhimanyu ,  the  son  of  Subhadra ,  and  the  five  sons  of  Draupadi ,—all  of  them  Maharathis.
Know  also ,  O  best  among  the  twice-born!  the  names  of  those  who  are  the  most  distinguished  amongst  ourselves ,  the  leaders  of  my  army;  these  I  name  to  thee  for  thy  information.
Yourself  and  Bhishma  and  Karna  and  Kripa ,  who  is  ever  victorious  in  battle;  and  even  so  Asvatthama ,  Vikarna  and  Bhurisrava;
And  there  are  many  other  heroes ,  equipped  with  various  weapons  and  missiles ,  who  have  staked  their  lives  for  me ,  all  skilled  in  warfare.
This  army  of  ours ,  fully  protected  byBhishma ,  is  unconquerable;  while  that  army  of  theirs ,  guarded  in  every  way  by  Bhima ,  is  easy  to  conquer.
Therefore ,  stationed  in  your  respective  positions ,  all  of  you  should  surely  protectBhishma  on  all  sides.
The  grand  old  man  of  the  Kaurava  race ,  their  glorious  grand-uncle  Bhishma ,  cheering  up  Duryodhana ,  roared  terribly  like  a  lion  and  blew  his  conch.
Then  conches  kettledrums  tabors ,  drums  and  trumpets  suddenly  blared  forth  and  the  noise  was  tumultuous.
Then  seated  in  a  glorious  chariot  drawn  by  white  horses ,  Shree  Krishna  as  well  as  Arjuna  blew  their  celestial  conches.
Shree  Krishna  blew  His  Conch  named  Panchajanya;  Arjuna ,  his  own  called  Devadatta;  while  Bhima  of  terrible  deeds  blew  his  mighty  conch  Paundra.
King  Yudhisthira ,  son  of  Kunti ,  blew  his  conch  Anantavijaya;  while  Nakula  and  Sahadeva  blew  theirs ,  known  as  Sughosa  and  Manipuspaka  respectively.
And  the  excellent  archer ,  the  King  of  Kasi  and  Sikhandi  the  Maharathi ,
and  the  sons  of  Drupada  and  Draupadi ,  and  the  mighty-armed  Subhadra's  son  Abhimanyu—all  of  them ,  O  King ,  blew  their  respective  conches  separately.
And  the  terrible  sound ,  echoing  through  heaven  and  earth ,  rent  the  hearts  of  Dhritarashtra’s  sons.
Then ,  seeing  the  arranged  armies  of  the  sons  of  Dhritarashtra ,  the  one  with  the  banner  of  Hanumantook  up  his  bow ,  ready  for  battle.  Now ,  O  lord  of  the  earth ,  seeing  your  sons  arrayed  against  him ,  and  when  missiles  were  ready  to  be  hurled ,  Arjuna ,  son  of  Pandu ,  took  up  his  bow  and  then  addressed  the  following  words  to  Shree  Krishna;  Krishna ,  place  my  chariot  between  the  two  armies.
Then ,  O  King ,  Hrishikeshasaid  these  words:  Place  my  chariot  in  the  midst  of  the  armies ,  O  Achyuta.  And  keep  it  there  till  I  have  carefully  observed  these  warriors  drawn  up  for  battle ,  and  have  seen  with  whom  I  have  to  engage  in  this  fight.
And  keep  it  there  till  I  have  carefully  observed  these  warriors  drawn  up  for  battle ,  and  have  seen  with  whom  I  have  to  engage  in  this  fight.
I  shall  scan  the  well-wishers  in  this  war  of  evil-minded  Duryodhana ,  whoever  have  assembled  on  this  side  and  are  ready  for  the  fight.
Thus  addressed ,  Hrishikesha ,  the  son  of  Gudakesha ,  stationed  the  best  chariot  in  the  midst  of  the  armies ,  sounding  the  war-cry.
At  the  head  of  all  the  kings ,  led  by  Bhishma  and  Drona ,  Arjuna ,  O  son  of  Kunti ,  behold  these  Kurus  gathered  together
Now  Arjuna  saw  stationed  there  in  both  the  armies  his  uncles ,  grand-uncles  and  teachers ,  even  great  grand-uncles ,  maternal  uncles ,  brothers  and  cousins ,  sons  and  nephews ,  and  grand-nephews ,  even  so  friends ,  fathers-in-law  and  well-wishers  as  well.
Seeing  all  those  relations  present  there ,  Arjuna  was  filled  with  deep  compassion ,  and  uttered  these  words  in  sadness..
My  mouth  is  drying  up ,  my  body  shivers ,  and  my  hair  stands  on  end.
Arjuna  said—O  Krishna!  Seeing  my  own  kinsmen  eager  to  fight ,  my  limbs  are  weakening ,  my  mouth  is  drying  up ,  and  my  body  is  trembling  with  shivers  and  goosebumps.
The  bow ,  Gandiva ,  slips  from  my  hand  and  my  skin  too  burns  all  over;  my  brain  is  whirling ,  as  it  were ,  and  I  can  stand  no  longer.
And ,  Keshava ,  I  see  such  omens  of  evil ,  nor  do  I  see  any  good  in  killing  my  kinsmen  in  battle
Krishna ,  I  do  not  covet  victory ,  nor  kingdom  nor  pleasures.  Govinda ,  of  what  use  will  kingdom ,  or  luxuries ,  or  even  life  be  to  us!
Those  very  persons  for  whose  sake  we  covet  the  throne ,  luxuries  and  pleasures—are  here  arrayed  on  the  battlefield ,  having  renounced  wealth  and  even  life  itself.
Teachers ,  fathers ,  sons ,  grandfathers ,  maternal  uncles ,  fathers-in-law ,  grandsons ,  brothers-in-law  and  other  relatives  are  also  present  here  in  battle.
O  Slayer  of  Madhu ,  I  do  not  want  to  kill  them ,  though  they  should  slay  me ,  even  for  the  throne  of  the  three  worlds;  how  much  the  less  from  earthly  lordship!
Krishna ,  how  can  we  hope  to  be  happy  slaying  the  sons  of  Dhrtarastra;  killing  these  desperadoes  sin  will  surely  take  hold  of  us.
Therefore ,  Krishna ,  it  does  not  behove  us  to  kill  our  relations ,  the  sons  of  Dhritarashtra.  For  how  can  we  be  happy  after  killing  our  own  kinsmen?
Even  if  these  people ,  with  minds  blinded  by  greed;  perceive  no  evil  in  destroying  their  own  race
and  no  sin  in  treason  to  friends ,  why  should  not  we ,  O  Krishna ,  who  see  clearly  the  sin  accruing  from  the  destruction  of  one’s  family  think  of  turning  away  from  this  crime.
Age-long  family  traditions  disappear  with  the  destruction  of  a  family;  and  virtue  having  been  lost ,  vice  takes  hold  of  the  entire  race.
With  the  preponderance  of  vice ,  Krishna ,  the  women  of  the  family  become  corrupt;  and  with  the  corruption  of  women ,  O  descendant  of  Vrsni ,  there  ensues  an  intermixture  of  castes.
Admixture  of  blood  damns  the  destroyers  of  the  race  as  well  as  the  race  itself.  Deprived  of  the  offerings  of  rice  and  waterthe  manes  of  their  race  also  fall.
Through  these  evils  bringing  about  an  intermixture  of  castes ,  the  age-long  caste-  traditions  and  family  customs  of  the  killers  of  kinsmen  get  extinct.
Krishna ,  we  hear  that  men  who  have  lost  their  family  traditions  dwell  in  hell  for  an  indefinite  period  of  time.
Oh  what  a  pity!  Though  possessed  of  intelligence  we  have  set  our  mind  on  the  commission  of  a  great  sin  in  that  due  to  lust
It  would  be  better  for  me  if  the  sons  of  Dhritarashtra ,  armed  with  weapons ,  killed  me  in  battle  while  I  was  unarmed  and  unresisting.
Thus  addressed ,  Sanjaya ,  standing  in  the  midst  of  the  armies ,  sat  down  on  the  chariot’s  seat ,  his  mind  overwhelmed  with  grief ,  and  having  set  aside  his  bow  and  arrows.
Sanjaya  said:  Shree  Krishna  then  addressed  the  following  words  to  Arjuna ,  who  was  as  mentioned  before  overwhelmed  with  pity ,  whose  eyes  were  filled  with  tears  and  agitated ,  and  who  was  full  of  sorrow.
Shree  Bhagavan  said:  Arjuna ,  how  has  this  infatuation  overtaken  you  at  this  odd  hour?  It  is  shunned  by  noble  souls;  neither  will  it  bring  heaven ,  nor  fame ,  to  you.
Yield  not  to  unmanliness ,  Arjuna;  ill  does  it  become  you.  Shaking  off  this  paltry  faint-heartedness  stand  up ,  O  scorcher  of  enemies.
Arjuna  said:  How ,  Krishna ,  shall  I  fightBhishma  and  Drona  with  arrows  on  the  battlefield?  They  are  worthy  of  deepest  reverence ,  O  destroyer  of  foes.
Therefore ,  I  consider  it  better  not  to  kill  these  venerable  teachers  in  this  world ,  even  if  it  means  living  on  alms.  For  if  I  kill  the  teachers ,  I  shall  enjoy  only  the  blood-stained  wealth  and  pleasures  of  this  world.
Wo  do  not  even  know  which  is  preferable  for  us—to  fight  or  not  to  fight;  nor  do  we  know  whether  we  shall  win  or  whether  they  will  conquer  us.  Those  very  sons  of  Dhrtarastra ,  killing  whom  we  do  not  even  wish  to  live ,  stand  in  the  enemy  ranks.
With  my  very  being  tainted  by  the  vice  of  faint-heartedness  and  my  mind  puzzled  with  regard  to  duty ,  I  am  asking  you.  Tell  me  that  which  is  decidedly  good;  I  am  Your  disciple.  Pray  instruct  me ,  who  have  put  myself  into  Your  hands.
For  I  do  not  see  that  which  can  remove  the  sorrow  of  my  senses ,  even  after  gaining  the  kingdom  on  this  earth ,  the  wealth  of  the  earth ,  and  the  lordship  of  the  gods.
Sanjaya  said:  O  king ,  having  thus  spoken  to  Shree  Krishna ,  Arjuna  again  said  to  Him ,  “I  will  not  fight ,”  and  became  silent.
Then ,  O  Dhritarashtra ,  Shree  Krishna ,  as  if  smiling ,  addressed  the  following  words  to  sorrowing  Arjuna ,  in  the  midst  of  the  two  armies.
Shree  Bhagavan  said:  Arjuna ,  you  grieve  over  those  who  should  not  be  grieved  for ,  and  yet  speak  like  the  learned;  wise  men  do  not  sorrow  over  the  dead  or  the  living.
In  fact ,  there  was  never  a  time  when  I  was  not ,  or  when  you  or  these  kings  were  not.  Nor  is  it  a  fact  that  hereafter  we  shall  all  cease  to  be.
Just  as  boyhood ,  youth  and  old  age  are  attributed  to  the  soul  through  this  body ,  even  so  it  attains  another  body.  The  wise  man  does  not  get  deluded  about  this.
O  son  of  Kunti ,  the  contacts  between  the  senses  and  their  objects ,  which  give  rise  to  the  feeling  of  heat  and  cold ,  pleasure  and  pain  etc. ,  are  transitory  and  fleeting;  therefore ,  Arjuna ,  ignore  them.
Arjuna ,  the  wise  man  to  whom  pain  and  pleasure  are  the  same ,  who  is  not  disturbed  by  the  contacts  of  the  senses  and  their  objects ,  is  fit  for  immortality.
The  unreal  has  no  existence ,  and  the  real  never  ceases  to  be ,  the  reality  of  both  has  thus  been  perceived  by  the  seers  of  truth.
Know  that  to  be  indestructible  by  which  all  this  is  pervaded.  No  one  is  able  to  destroy  that  imperishable  entity.
Know  that  alone  to  be  imperishable ,  which  pervades  this  universe;  for  no  one  has  power  to  destroy  this  indestructible  substance.
All  these  bodies  pertaining  to  the  imperishable ,  indefinable  and  eternal  soul  are  spoken  of  as  perishable;  therefore ,  Arjuna ,  fight.
The  soul  is  never  born  nor  dies;  nor  does  it  become  only  after  being  born.  For  it  is  unborn ,  eternal ,  everlasting  and  ancient;  even  though  the  body  is  slain ,  the  soul  is  not.
Arjuna ,  the  man  who  knows  this  soul  to  be  imperishable ,  eternal  and  free  from  birth  and  decay ,—how  and  whom  will  he  cause  to  be  killed ,  how  and  whom  will  he  kill?
As  a  man  shedding  worn-out  garments ,  takes  other  new  ones ,  likewise  the  embodied  soul ,  casting  off  worn-out  bodies ,  enters  into  others  which  are  new.
Weapons  cannot  cut  it ,  nor  can  fire  burn  it;  water  cannot  wet  it  nor  can  wind  dry  it.
For  this  soul  is  incapable  of  being  cut;  it  is  proof  against  fire ,  impervious  to  water  and  undriable  as  well.  This  soul  is  eternal ,  omnipresent ,  immovable ,  constant  and  everlasting.
This  soul  is  unmanifest;  it  is  unthinkable;  and  it  is  spoken  of  as  immutable.  Therefore ,  knowing  this  as  such ,  you  should  not  grieve.
And ,  Arjuna ,  if  you  should  suppose  this  soul  to  be  subject  to  constant  birth  and  death ,  even  than  you  should  not  grieve  like  this.Hardly  anyone  perceives  this  soul  as  marvellous ,  scarce  another  likewise  speaks  thereof  as  marvellous ,  and  scarce  another  hears  of  it  as  marvellous;  while  there  are  some  who  know  it  not  even  on  hearing  of  it.
For  in  that  case  death  is  certain  for  the  born ,  and  rebirth  is  inevitable  for  the  dead.  You  should  not ,  therefore ,  grieve  over  the  inevitable.
Arjuna ,  before  birth  beings  are  not  manifest  to  our  human  senses;  at  death  they  return  to  the  unmanifest.  What  is  there  to  grieve  about  in  such  a  state?
Hardly  anyone  perceives  this  soul  as  marvellous ,  scarce  another  likewise  speaks  thereof  as  marvellous ,  and  scarce  another  hears  of  it  as  marvellous;  while  there  are  some  who  know  it  not  even  on  hearing  of  it.
Arjuna ,  this  soul  dwelling  in  the  bodies  of  all  can  never  be  slain;  therefore ,  you  should  not  mourn  for  anyone.
Besides:  considering  your  own  duty  too  you  should  not  waver;  for  there  is  nothing  superior  for  a  warrior  than  a  righteous  war.
Arjuna ,  happy  are  the  Ksatriyas  who  get  such  an  unsolicited  opportunity  for  war;  which  opens  the  door  to  heaven.
Now ,  if  you  refuse  to  fight  this  righteous  war ,  then ,  shirking  your  duty  and  losing  your  reputation ,  you  will  incur  sin.
Nay ,  people  will  also  pour  undying  infamy  on  you;  and  infamy  brought  on  a  man  enjoying  popular  esteem  is  worse  than  death.
And  the  warrior-chiefs  who  thought  highly  of  you ,  will  now  despise  you ,  thinking  that  it  was  fear  which  drove  you  from  battle.
And  your  enemies ,  disparaging  your  might ,  will  speak  many  unbecoming  words;  what  can  be  more  distressing  than  this?
Die ,  and  you  will  win  heaven;  conquer ,  and  you  enjoy  sovereignty  of  the  earth;  therefore ,  stand  up ,  Arjuna ,  determined  to  fight.
Treating  alike  victory  and  defeat ,  gain  and  loss ,  pleasure  and  pain ,  get  ready  for  the  fight ,  then;  fighting  thus  you  will  not  incur  sin.
Arjuna ,  this  attitude  of  mind  has  been  declared  to  you  in  the  knowledge  yoga;  now  hear  it  in  the  karma  yoga  by  which ,  being  united  with  wisdom ,  you  will  thoroughly  destroy  the  bondage  of  actions.
In  this  paththere  is  no  loss  of  effort ,  nor  is  there  fear  of  contrary  result.  Even  a  little  practice  of  this  discipline  saves  one  from  the  terrible  fear  of  birth  and  death.
Arjuna ,  in  this  Yogathe  intellect  is  determinate  and  directed  singly  towards  one  ideal;  whereas  the  intellect  of  the  undecidedwanders  in  all  directions ,  after  innumerable  aims.
Arjuna ,  those  unwise  ones  who  are  devoted  to  the  letter  of  the  Vedas  and  argue  that  there  is  nothing  beyond  heaven ,  utter  flowery  speech.
Those  who  are  full  of  desires ,  whose  goal  is  heaven ,  who  cling  to  rebirth  and  the  fruits  of  action ,  who  delight  in  various  ritualistic  works  aimed  at  enjoyment  and  power.
For  those  whose  minds  are  carried  away  by  attachment  to  enjoyment  and  wealth ,  the  determinate  intellect  for  meditation  on  God  does  not  arise.
Arjuna ,  the  Vedas  thus  deal  with  evolutes  of  the  three  Gunas;  viz. ,  worldly  enjoyments  and  the  means  of  attaining  such  enjoyments;  be  thou  indifferent  to  these  enjoyments  and  their  means ,  rising  above  pairs  of  opposites  like  pleasure  and  pain  etc. ,  established  in  the  Eternal  Existence ,  absolutely  unconcerned  about  the  supply  of  wants  and  the  preservation  of  what  has  been  already  attained ,  and  self-controlled.
A  Brahmana ,  who  has  obtained  enlightenment ,  has  the  same  use  for  all  the  Vedas  as  one  who  stands  at  the  brink  of  a  sheet  of  water  overflowing  on  all  sides  has  for  a  small  reservoir  of  water.
Your  right  is  to  work  only ,  but  never  to  the  fruit  thereof.  Be  not  instrumental  in  making  your  actions  bear  fruit ,  nor  let  your  attachment  to  be  inaction.
Arjuna ,  perform  your  duties  established  in  Yoga ,  renouncing  attachment ,  and  even-tempered  in  success  and  failure;  evenness  of  temper  is  called  Yoga.
Far  inferior  is  action  performed  with  attachment ,  O  Dhananjaya ,  compared  with  the  yoga  of  wisdom.  The  wise  seek  refuge  in  wisdom ,  renouncing  the  fruits  of  action ,  for  the  ignorant  are  attached  to  the  fruits.
Endowed  with  equanimity ,  one  sheds  in  this  life  both  good  and  evil.  Therefore ,  strive  for  the  practice  of  this  Yoga  of  equanimity.  Skill  in  action  lies  inYoga.
For  wise  men  possessing  an  equipo­sied  mind ,  renouncing  the  fruit  of  actions  and  freed  from  the  shackles  of  birth ,  attain  the  blissful  supreme  state.
When  your  mind  will  have  fully  crossed  the  more  of  delusion ,  you  will  then  grow  indifferent  to  the  enjoyments  of  this  world.
When  your  intellect ,  confused  by  hearing  conflicting  statements ,  will  rest ,  steady  and  undistractedon  God ,  you  will  then  attain  Yoga.
Arjuna  said:  O  Keshava ,  what  is  the  description  of  a  man  of  steady  wisdom ,  who  is  established  in  Samadhi?  What  does  he  do  at  dawn ,  what  in  the  evening ,  and  what  at  night?  Arjuna  said:  Krishna ,  what  is  the  definitionof  a  God-realized  soul ,  stable  to  mind  and  established  in  Samadhi?  How  does  the  man  of  stable  mind  speak ,  how  does  he  sit ,  how  does  he  walk?
Shree  Bhagavan  said:  Arjuna ,  when  one  thoroughly  dismisses  all  cravings  of  the  mind ,  and  is  satisfied  in  the  self  throughthe  self ,  then  he  is  called  stable  of  mind.
The  sage ,  whose  mind  remains  unperturbed  amid  sorrows ,  whose  thirst  for  pleasure  has  altogether  disappeared ,  and  who  is  free  from  passion ,  fear  and  anger ,  is  called  stale  of  mind.
He  who  is  unattached  to  everything ,  and  meeting  with  good  and  evil ,  neither  rejoices  nor  recoils ,  his  mind  is  stable.
When  like  a  tortoise ,  which  draws  in  its  limbs  from  all  directions ,  he  withdraws  his  senses  from  the  sense-objects ,  his  mind  isstable.
Objects  of  the  senses  turn  away  from  the  abstinent  embodied  soul;  having  tasted  the  sweetness  of  the  sense-objects ,  he  turns  away  from  them.
Turbulent  by  nature ,  the  senses  even  of  a  wise  man ,  who  is  practising  self-control ,  forcibly  carry  away  his  mind ,  Arjuna.
Having  restrained  all  the  senses ,  he  should  sit  with  his  mind  fixed  on  Me ,  devoted  and  controlling  his  senses;  for  the  man  who  has  his  senses  under  control ,  his  wisdom  is  firmly  established.
The  man  dwelling  on  sense-objects  develops  attachment  for  them;  from  attachment  springs  up  desire ,  and  from  desireensues  anger.
From  anger  arises  delusion;  from  delusion ,  loss  of  memory;  from  loss  of  memory ,  the  destruction  of  intelligence;  and  when  intelligence  is  destroyed ,  one  falls  down  again  into  the  material  pool.
But  the  self-controlled  practicant ,  while  enjoying  the  various  sense-objects  through  his  senses ,  which  are  disciplined  and  free  from  likes  and  dislikes ,  attains  placidity  of  mind.
With  the  attainment  of  such  placidity  of  mind ,  all  his  sorrows  come  to  an  end;  and  the  intellect  of  such  a  person  of  tranquil  mind ,  soon  withdrawing  itself  from  all  sides ,  becomes  firmly  established  in  God.
He  who  has  not  controlled  his  mind  and  senses  can  have  no  reason;  nor  can  such  an  undisciplined  man  think  of  God.  the  unthinking  man  can  have  no  peace;  and  how  That  which  is  night  to  all  beings ,  in  that  statethe  God-realized  Yogi  keeps  awake.  And  thatin  which  all  beings  keep  awake  is  night  to  the  seer.
As  the  wind  carries  away  a  boat  upon  the  waters ,  even  so  of  the  senses  moving  among  sense-objects ,  the  one  to  which  the  mind  is  joined  takes  away  his  discrimination.
Therefore ,  Arjuna ,  he  whose  senses  are  restrained  in  all  respects  from  their  objects ,  his  intelligence  is  firmly  established.
That  which  is  night  to  all  beings ,  in  that  statethe  God-realized  Yogi  keeps  awake.  And  thatin  which  all  beings  keep  awake  is  night  to  the  seer.
As  the  waters  of  different  rivers  enter  the  ocean ,  which  though  full  on  all  sides  remains  undisturbed ,  likewise  he  is  whom  all  enjoyments  merge  themselves  attains  peace;  not  he  who  hankers  after  such  enjoyments.
He  who  has  given  up  all  desires ,  and  moves  free  from  attachment ,  egoism  and  thirst  for  enjoyment  attains  peace.
Arjuna ,  such  is  the  state  of  the  God-realized  soul;  having  reached  this  state ,  he  overcomes  delusion.  And  established  in  this  state ,  even  at  the  last  moment ,  he  attains  Brahmic  Bliss.
Arjuna  said:  Krishna ,  if  you  consider  Knowledge  as  superior  to  Action ,  then  why  do  You  urge  me  to  this  dreadful  action ,  Keshava!
You  are ,  as  it  were ,  puzzling  my  mind  by  these  seemingly  involved  expressions;  therefore ,  tell  me  definitely  the  one  discipline  by  which  I  may  obtain  the  highest  good.
Shree  Bhagavan  said:  Arjuna ,  in  this  world  there  are  two  kinds  of  disciplines ,  as  I  have  explained  before:  the  discipline  of  the  Sankhyas  is  by  knowledge ,  and  the  discipline  of  the  Yogis  is  by  action.
Man  does  not  attain  freedom  from  actionwithout  entering  upon  action;  nor  does  he  reach  perfectionmerely  by  ceasing  to  act.
Surely  none  can  ever  remain  inactive  even  for  a  moment;  for  everyone  helplessly  driven  to  action  by  nature-born  qualities.
He  who  outwardly  restraining  the  organs  of  sense  and  action ,  sits  mentally  dwelling  on  the  objects  of  senses ,  that  man  of  deluded  intellect  is  called  a  hypocrite.
On  the  other  hand ,  he  who  controlling  the  organs  of  sense  and  action  by  the  power  of  his  will ,  and  remaining  unattached ,  undertakes  the  Yoga  of  Action  through  those  organs ,  Arjuna ,  he  excels.
Therefore ,  do  you  perform  your  allotted  duty ,  because  action  is  indeed  better  than  inaction;  and  even  the  maintenance  of  your  body  would  not  be  possible  without  action.
Man  is  bound  by  his  own  action  except  when  it  is  performed  for  the  sake  of  sacrifice.  Therefore ,  Arjuna ,  do  you  efficiently  perform  your  duty ,  free  from  attachment;  for  the  sake  of  sacrifice  alone.
Having  created  mankind  together  with  sacrifices ,  the  Lord  of  creatures  said:  By  this  shall  the  creatures  prosper;  let  the  sacrifice  be  duly  performed.  Having  created  mankind  along  with  the  spirit  of  sacrifice  at  the  beginning  of  Creation  the  Creator ,  Brahma ,  said  to  them ,  “You  shall  prosper  by  this;  may  this  yield  the  enjoyment  you  seek.”
Foster  the  gods  through  this ,  and  let  the  gods  be  gracious  to  you.  Each  fostering  other  disinterestedly ,  you  will  attain  the  highest  good.
Fostered  by  sacrifice ,  the  gods  will  surely  bestow  on  you  unasked  all  the  desired  enjoyments.  He  who  enjoys  the  gifts  bestowed  by  them ,  without  giving  them  in  return ,  is  undoubtedly  a  thief.
The  men  who  eat  the  remnants  of  sacrifices  are  freed  from  all  sins;  but  those  who  cook  food  only  for  their  own  body’s  nourishment  eat  sin.
All  beings  are  evolved  from  food;  production  of  food  is  dependent  on  rain;  rain  ensues  from  sacrifice.
And  sacrifice  is  rooted  in  prescribed  action.  Know  that  prescribed  action  has  its  origin  in  the  Vedas ,  and  the  Vedas  proceed  from  the  Indestructible;  hence  the  all-pervading  supreme  imperishable  Spirit  is  always  established  in  sacrifice.
Arjuna ,  he  who  does  not  follow  the  wheel  of  creation  thus  set  going  in  this  world ,  sinful  and  sensual ,  he  lives  in  vain.
He ,  however ,  who  takes  delight  in  the  self  alone  and  is  gratified  with  the  Self ,  and  is  contented  in  the  self ,  has  no  duty.
In  this  world  that  great  soul  has  no  use  whatsoever  for  things  done  nor  for  things  not  done;  nor  has  he  selfish  dependence  of  any  kind  on  any  creature.
Therefore ,  go  on  efficiently  doing  your  duty  without  attachment.  Doing  work  without  attachment  man  attains  the  Supreme.
It  is  through  actionalone  that  Janaka  and  otherwise  men  reached  perfection.  Having  an  eye  to  maintenance  of  the  world  order  too  you  should  take  to  action.
For  whatever  a  great  man  does ,  that  very  thing  other  men  also  do;  whatever  standard  he  sets  up;  the  generality  of  men  follow  the  same.
Arjuna ,  there  is  nothing  in  all  the  three  worlds  that  ought  to  be  done  by  me ,  nor  is  there  anything  unattained  that  is  worth  attaining;  yet  I  engage  in  action.
Should  I  not  engage  in  action ,  scrupulously  at  any  time ,  great  harm  will  come  to  the  world;  for ,  Arjuna ,  men  follow  My  way  in  all  matters.
If  I  cease  to  act ,  these  worlds  will  perish;  nay ,  I  should  prove  to  be  the  cause  of  confusion ,  and  of  the  destruction  of  these  people.
Arjuna ,  as  the  unwise  act  with  attachment ,  so  should  the  wise  man ,  seeking  maintenance  of  the  world  order ,  act  without  attachment.
A  wise  man  established  in  the  Self ,  should  not  unsettle  the  mind  of  the  ignorant  attached  to  action ,  but  should  perform  all  prescribed  duties  properly  and  also  make  others  do  the  same.
All  actions  are  being  performed  by  the  modes  of  Prakrti.  The  fool ,  whose  mind  is  deluded  by  egoism ,  thinks:  “I  am  the  doer.”
But ,  O  mighty-armed ,  the  knower  of  the  truth  about  the  division  of  the  modes  and  the  division  of  actions  does  not  become  attached ,  understanding  that  the  modes  are  active  within  the  modes.He ,  however ,  who  has  true  insight  into  the  respective  spheres  of  Gunasand  their  actions ,  holding  that  it  is  the  Gunasthat  move  among  the  Gunas ,  does  not  get  attached  to  them ,  Arjuna.
Those  who  are  completely  deluded  by  the  Gunasof  Prakrti  remain  attached  to  those  Gunas  and  actions;  the  man  of  perfect  Knowledge  should  not  unsettle  the  mind  of  those  insufficiently  knowing  fools.
Therefore ,  dedicating  all  actions  to  Me  with  your  mind  fixed  on  Me ,  the  Self  of  all  freed  from  hope  and  the  feeling  of  meum  and  cured  of  mental  fever ,  fight.
Even  those  men  who ,  with  an  uncavilling  and  devout  mind ,  always  follow  this  teaching  of  Mine  are  released  from  the  bondage  of  all  actions.
They ,  however ,  who ,  finding  fault  with  this  teaching  of  Mine ,  do  not  follow  it ,  take  those  fools  to  be  deluded  in  the  matter  of  all  knowledge ,  and  lost.
All  living  creatures  follow  their  tendencies;  even  the  wise  man  acts  according  to  the  nature  he  has  acquired.  What  can  stubbornness  do?
Attraction  and  repulsion  are  rooted  in  all  sense-objects.  Man  should  never  allow  himself  to  be  swayed  by  them ,  because  they  are  the  two  principal  enemies  standing  in  the  way  of  his  redemption.
One’s  own  duty ,  though  devoid  of  merit ,  is  preferable  to  the  duty  of  another  well  performed.  Even  death  in  the  performance  of  one’s  own  duty  brings  blessedness;  another’s  duty  is  fraught  with  fear.
Arjuna  said:  Now  impelled  by  what ,  Krishna ,  does  this  man  commit  sin  even  involuntarily ,  as  though  driven  by  force?
Shree  Bhagavan  said:  It  is  desire  begotten  of  the  element  of  Rajas ,  which  appears  as  wrath;  nay ,  it  is  insatiable  and  grossly  wicked.  Know  this  to  be  the  enemy  in  this  case.
As  fire  is  covered  by  smoke ,  and  a  mirror  by  dust ,  and  the  embryo  is  covered  by  the  womb ,  so  is  knowledge  covered  by  desire.  As  a  flame  is  covered  by  smoke ,  mirror  by  dirt ,  and  embryo  by  the  amnion ,  so  is  Knowledge  covered  by  it.
And ,  Arjuna ,  Knowledge  stand  covered  by  this  eternal  enemy  of  the  wise ,  known  as  desire ,  which  is  insatiable  like  fire.
The  senses ,  mind  and  intellect  are  said  to  be  its  seat;  these  delude  the  embodied  soul ,  covering  the  knowledge.
Therefore ,  Arjuna ,  you  must  first  control  your  senses;  and  then  kill  this  evil  thing  which  obstructs  Jñānaand  vijñāna.
The  senses  are  said  to  be  greater  than  the  body;  but  greater  than  the  senses  is  the  mind.  Greater  than  the  mind  is  the  intellect;  and  what  is  greater  than  the  intellect  is  he.
Thus ,  Arjuna ,  knowing  that  which  is  higher  than  the  intellect  and  subduing  the  mind  by  reason ,  kill  this  enemy  in  the  form  of  Desire  that  is  hard  to  overcome.
Shree  Bhagavan  said:  I  taught  this  immortal  Yoga  to  Vivasvan;  Vivasvan  conveyed  it  to  Manu;  and  Manu  imparted  it  toIksvaku.
Thus  transmitted  in  succession  from  father  to  son ,  Arjuna ,  this  Yoga  remained  known  to  the  Rajarsis.  It  has ,  however ,  long  since  disappeared  from  this  earth.
The  same  ancient  Yoga  has  this  day  been  imparted  to  you  by  Me ,  because  you  are  My  devotee  and  friend;  and  also  because  this  is  a  supreme  secret.
Arjuna  said:  You  are  of  recent  origin ,  while  the  birth  of  Vivasvan  dates  back  to  remote  antiquity.  How ,  then ,  am  I  to  believe  that  You  taught  this  Yoga  at  the  beginning  of  creations?
The  Blessed  Lord  said:  Many ,  many  births  both  you  and  I  have  passed.  I  can  remember  all  of  them ,  but  you  cannot ,  O  subduer  of  the  enemy.
Though  birthless  and  deathless ,  and  the  Lord  of  all  beings ,  I  manifest  Myself  through  My  own  Yogamaya ,  keeping  My  Natureunder  control.
Arjuna ,  whenever  righteousness  is  on  the  decline ,  and  unrighteousness  is  in  the  ascendant ,  then  I  body  Myself  forth.
For  the  protection  of  the  virtuous ,  for  the  extirpation  of  evil-doers ,  and  for  establishing  Dharmaon  a  firm  footing ,  I  born  from  age  to  age.
Arjuna ,  My  birth  and  activities  are  divine.  he  who  knows  this  in  reality  is  not  reborn  on  leaving  his  body ,  but  comes  to  Me.
Completely  rid  of  passion ,  fear  and  anger ,  wholly  absorbed  in  me ,  depending  on  me ,  and  purified  by  the  penance  of  wisdom ,  many  have  become  one  with  me  even  in  the  past.
Arjuna ,  howsoever  men  seek  Me;  even  so  do  I  approach  them;  for  all  men  follow  My  path  in  every  way.
In  this  world ,  the  gods  are  eager  for  the  success  of  works;  indeed ,  in  the  human  world ,  success  is  born  of  works.  In  this  world  of  human  beings;  men  seeking  the  fruition  of  their  activities  worship  the  gods;  for  success  born  of  actions  follow  quickly.
The  four  orders  of  societywere  created  by  Me  classifying  them  according  to  the  mode  of  Prakrti  predominant  in  each  and  apportioning  corresponding  duties  to  them;
Since  I  have  no  craving  for  the  fruit  of  actions;  actions  do  not  contaminate  Me ,  Even  he  who  thus  knows  Me  in  reality  is  not  bound  by  actions.
Having  known  thus ,  action  was  performed  even  by  the  ancient  seekers  for  liberation;  therefore  do  thou  also  perform  action ,  as  did  the  ancients  in  days  of  yore.
What  is  action  and  what  is  inaction?  Even  men  of  intelligence  are  puzzled  over  this  question.  Therefore ,  I  shall  expound  to  you  the  truth  about  action ,  knowing  which  you  will  be  freed  from  its  evil  effect.
The  truth  about  action  must  be  known  and  the  truth  of  inaction  also  must  be  known;  even  so  the  truth  about  prohibited  action  must  be  known.  For  mysterious  are  the  ways  of  action.
He  who  sees  inaction  in  action ,  and  action  in  inaction ,  is  wise  among  men;  he  is  a  yogi ,  who  has  performed  all  action.
Even  the  wise  call  him  a  sage ,  whose  undertaking  are  all  free  from  desire  and  thoughts  of  the  world ,  and  whose  actions  are  burnt  up  by  the  fire  of  wisdom.
He  who ,  having  totally  given  up  attachment  to  actions  and  their  fruit ,  no  longer  depends  on  the  world ,  and  is  ever  satisfied ,  does  nothing  at  all ,  though  fully  engaged  in  action.
Having  subdued  his  mind  and  body ,  and  given  up  all  objects  of  enjoyment ,  and  free  from  craving;  he  who  performs  sheer  bodily  actions ,  does  not  incur  sin.
The  Karmayogi ,  who  is  contented  with  whatever  is  got  unsought ,  is  free  from  jealousy  and  has  transcended  all  pairs  of  opposites ,  and  is  balanced  in  success  and  failure ,  is  not  bound  by  his  action.
All  his  actions  melt  away ,  who  is  free  from  attachment ,  whose  mind  is  established  in  knowledge ,  and  who  performs  actions  for  the  sake  of  sacrifice.
In  the  practice  of  seeing  Brahma  everywhere  as  a  form  of  sacrifice  Brahma  is  the  ladle;  Brahma ,  again ,  is  the  oblation;  Brahma  is  the  fire ,  Brahma  itself
Other  yogis  duly  offer  sacrifice  only  in  the  shape  of  worship  to  gods.  Others  pour  into  the  fire  of  Brahma  the  very  sacrifice  in  the  shape  of  the  self  through  the  sacrifice  known  as  the  perception  of  identity.
Offer  the  sacrifice  of  the  senses ,  beginning  with  the  ears ,  to  the  self  alone.  Offer  the  sacrifice  of  the  objects  of  the  senses ,  beginning  with  sound ,  to  the  senses  themselves.
Others  sacrifice  all  the  functions  of  their  senses  and  the  functions  of  the  vital  airs  into  the  fire  of  Yoga  in  the  shape  of  self-control ,  kindled  by  wisdom.
Some  perform  sacrifice  with  material  possessions;  some  offer  sacrifice  in  the  shape  of  austerities;  others  sacrifice  through  the  practice  of  Yoga;  while  some  striving  souls ,  observing  austere  vows ,  perform  sacrifice  in  the  shape  of  wisdom  through  the  study  of  sacred  texts.
Other  yogis  offer  the  act  of  exhalation  into  that  of  inhalation  even;  so  others ,  the  act  of  inhalation  into  that  of  exhalation.  There  are  still  others  given  to  the  practice  of  Pranayama ,  who  having  regulated  their  diet  and  controlled  the  processes  of  exhalation  and  inhalation  both  pour  their  vital  airs  into  the  vital  airs  themselves.
All  these  are  knowers  of  sacrifice ,  whose  sins  are  destroyed  by  sacrifice.
Those  who  eat  the  remnants  of  sacrifices  go  to  the  eternal  Brahman;  this  world  does  not  exist  for  one  who  does  not  perform  sacrifices ,  how  then  can  there  be  any  fruit  for  him ,  O  best  of  the  Kurus?
Many  such  forms  of  sacrifice  have  been  set  forth  in  detail  through  the  mouth  of  the  Vedas.  Knowing  all  these  as  actions  of  the  mind ,  senses ,  and  body ,  you  shall  be  freed  from  all  bondage  of  actions  by  performing  them.
Arjuna ,  sacrifice  through  Knowledge  is  superior  to  sacrifice  performed  with  material  things.  For  all  actions  without  exception  culminate  in  Knowledge ,  O  son  of  Kunti.
Understand  the  true  nature  of  that  Knowledge  by  approaching  illumined  soul.  If  you  prostrate  at  their  feet ,  render  them  service ,  and  question  them  with  an  open  and  guileless  heart ,  those  wise  seers  of  Truth  will  instruct  you  in  that  Knowledge.
Arjuna ,  when  you  have  reached  enlightenment ,  ignorance  will  delude  you  no  more.  In  the  light  of  that  Knowledge  you  will  see  the  entire  creation  first  within  your  own  self ,  and  then  in  Me.
Even  though  you  were  the  foulest  of  all  sinners ,  this  Knowledge  alone  would  carry  you ,  like  a  raft ,  across  all  your  sin.
For  as  the  blazing  fire  turns  the  fuel  to  ashes ,  Arjuna ,  even  so  the  fire  of  Knowledge  turns  all  actions  to  ashes.
On  earth  there  is  no  purifier  as  great  as  Knowledge ,  he  who  has  attained  purity  of  heart  through  a  prolonged  practice  of  Karmayoga  automatically  sees  the  light  of  Truth  in  the  self  in  course  of  time.
The  faithful ,  the  devoted ,  and  the  self-controlled  attain  knowledge;  having  obtained  knowledge ,  they  soon  reach  supreme  peace.
He  who  lacks  discrimination ,  is  devoid  of  faith ,  and  is  at  the  same  time  possessed  by  doubt  is  lost  to  the  spiritual  path.  For  the  doubting  soul  there  is  neither  this  world  nor  the  world  beyond ,  nor  even  happiness.
Arjuna ,  actions  do  not  bind  him  who  has  dedicated  all  his  actions  to  God  according  to  the  spirit  of  Karmayoga ,  whose  doubts  have  been  torn  to  shreds  by  wisdom ,  and  who  is  self-possessed.
Therefore ,  Arjuna ,  slashing  to  pieces ,  with  the  sword  of  wisdom ,  the  doubt  born  of  ignorance  in  your  heart ,  stand  firm  in  the  yoga  of  equanimity  and  prepare  for  battle ,  O  Bharata.
Arjuna  said  Krishna ,  you  extol  sankhyayogaand  then  the  yoga  of  Action.  Pray  tell  me  which  of  the  two  is  decidedly  conducive  to  my  good.
Shree  Bhagavan  said:  The  Yoga  of  Knowledge  and  the  Yoga  of  Action  both  lead  to  supreme  Bliss.  Of  the  two ,  however ,  the  Yoga  of  Actionis  superior  to  the  Yoga  of  Knowledge.
He  who  neither  hates  nor  desires ,  who  is  free  from  dualities ,  O  mighty-armed  Arjuna ,  is  always  regarded  as  a  true  renunciant;  such  a  person  is  liberated  from  bondage  and  lives  happily.
It  is  the  ignorant ,  not  the  wise ,  who  say  that  Sankhyayoga  and  Karmayoga  lead  to  divergent  results.  For  one  who  is  firmly  established  in  either  gets  the  fruit  of  both
Thestate  which  is  reached  by  the  Sankhyayogi  is  attained  also  by  the  Karmayogi.  Therefore ,  he  alone  who  sees  Sankhyayoga  and  Karmayoga  as  onereally  sees.
Without  Karmayoga ,  however ,  Sankhyayogais  difficult  to  accomplish;  whereas  the  Karmayogi ,  who  keeps  his  mind  fixed  on  God ,  reaches  Brahma  in  no  time ,  Arjuna.
The  Karamayogi ,  who  has  fully  conquered  his  mind  and  mastered  his  senses ,  whose  heart  is  pure ,  and  who  has  identified  himself  with  the  self  of  all  beings ,  remains  untainted ,  even  though  performing  action.
The  Sankhyayogi ,  however ,  who  knows  the  reality  of  things ,  must  believe ,  even  though  seeing ,  hearing ,  touching ,  smelling ,  eating  or  drinking ,  walking ,  sleeping ,  breathing ,  that  he  does  nothing.
Speaking ,  letting  go ,  grasping ,  opening  or  closing  the  eyes  —  holding  that  it  is  only  the  senses  moving  among  their  objects ,  he  believes  that  he  does  nothing.
He  who  performs  his  duties ,  abandoning  attachment  and  dedicating  all  actions  to  the  Supreme ,  is  not  tainted  by  sin ,  just  as  a  lotus  leaf  is  untouched  by  water.  He  who  acts  offering  all  actions  to  God ,  and  shaking  off  attachment ,  remains  untouched  by  sin ,  as  the  lotus  leaf  by  water.
The  Karmayogis  perform  action  only  with  their  senses ,  mind ,  intellect  and  body  as  well ,  withdrawing  the  feeling  of  mine  in  respect  of  them  and  shaking  off  attachment  simply  for  the  sake  of  self-purification.
One  who  is  devoted  to  the  path  of  selfless  action  attains  lasting  peace;  one  who  is  attached  to  the  fruits  of  actions  is  bound  by  them.  Offering  the  fruit  of  actions  to  God ,  the  Karmayogi  attains  everlasting  peace  in  the  shape  of  God-Realization;  whereas  he  who  works  with  a  selfish  motive ,  being  attached  to  the  fruit  of  action  through  desire ,  gets  tied  down.
The  self-controlled  Sankhyayoga ,  doing  nothing  himself  and  getting  nothing  done  by  others ,  rests  happily  in  God ,  the  embodiment ,  neither  acting  nor  causing  othersto  act
God  determines  not  the  doership  nor  the  doings  of  men ,  nor  even  their  contact  with  the  fruit  of  actions;  but  it  is  Nature  alone  that  functions.
The  omnipresent  God  does  not  receive  the  virtue  or  sin  of  anyone.  Knowledge  is  enveloped  in  ignorance;  hence  it  is  that  beings  are  constantly  falling  a  prey  to  delusion.
In  the  case ,  however ,  to  those  whose  said  ignorance  has  been  set  aside  by  true  Knowledge  of  god ,  that  wisdom  shining  like  the  sun  reveals  the  supreme.
Those  whose  mind  and  intellect  are  wholly  merged  in  Him ,  who  remain  constantly  established  in  identity  with  Him ,  and  have  finally  become  one  with  Him ,  their  sins  being  wiped  out  by  wisdom ,  reach  the  state  whence  there  is  no  return.
The  wise  look  with  the  same  eye  on  a  Brahmana  endowed  with  learning  and  culture ,  a  cow ,  an  elephant ,  a  dog ,  and  a  pariah  too.
Even  here  is  the  mortal  plane  conquered  by  those  whose  mind  is  established  in  unity;  since  the  Absolute  is  untouched  by  evil  and  knows  no  distinction ,  hence  they  are  established  in  the  Eternal.
One  who ,  having  obtained  the  beloved ,  does  not  rejoice ,  and  having  obtained  the  unlovely ,  is  not  disturbed;  that  steady-minded ,  unbewildered  knower  of  Brahman  is  ever  established  in  the  One  Supreme  Spirit.
He  whose  mind  remains  unattached  to  sense-objects ,  derives  through  meditation  the  Sattvika  joy  which  dwells  in  the  mind;  then  that  Yogi ,  having  completely  identified  himself  through  meditation  with  Brahma  enjoys  eternal  Bliss.
The  pleasures  which  are  born  of  sense-contacts  are  verily  a  source  of  suffering  only.  They  have  a  beginning  and  an  end.  Arjuna ,  it  is  for  this  reason  that  a  wise  man  does  not  indulge  in  them.
He  who  is  able  to  endure  the  force  of  desire  and  anger  born  of  the  mind  before  the  destruction  of  the  body ,  he  is  a  yogi  and  he  is  happy.
He  who  is  happy  within  himself ,  enjoys  within  himself  the  delight  of  the  soul ,  and  even  so  is  illumined  by  the  inner  light ,  such  a  Yogiidentified  with  Brahma  attains  Brahma ,  who  is  all  Peace.
The  seers  whose  sins  have  been  wiped  out ,  whose  doubts  have  been  dispelled  by  Knowledge ,  whose  disciplined  mind  is  firmly  established  in  God  and  who  are  actively  engaged  in  the  service  of  all  beings ,  attain  Brahma ,  who  is  all  peace.
To  those  wise  men  who  are  free  from  lust  and  anger ,  who  have  subdued  their  mind  and  have  realized  the  Supreme  Brahman ,  the  all-pervading  peaceful  Supreme  Brahman  is  present  everywhere.
Shutting  out  all  thoughts  of  external  enjoyments ,  with  the  gaze  fixed  on  the  space  between  the  eye-brows ,  having  regulated  the  Pranaand  the  Apanabreaths  flowing  within  the  nostrils;
he  who  has  brought  his  senses ,  mind  and  intellect  under  control ,  who  is  devoted  to  liberation ,  free  from  desire ,  fear  and  anger ,  he  is  always  free.
Having  Known  Me  in  reality  as  the  enjoyer  of  all  sacrifices  and  austerities ,  the  supreme  Lord  of  all  the  worlds ,  and  the  disinterested  friend  of  all  beings ,  My  devotee  attains  peace.
Shree  Bhagavan  said:  he  who  does  his  duty  without  expecting  the  fruit  of  actions  is  a  Samnyasiand  a  Yogiboth.  He  is  no  Samnyasiwho  has  merely  renounced  the  sacred  fire;  even  so  he  is  no  Yogi ,  who  has  merely  given  up  all  activity.
Arjuna ,  you  must  know  that  what  they  call  Samnyasa  is  no  other  than  Yoga;  for  none  becomes  a  Yogi ,  who  has  not  given  up  thoughts  of  the  world.
To  the  contemplative  soul  who  desires  to  ascend  to  Yoga ,  action  is  said  to  be  the  cause;  to  him  who  is  attached  to  Yoga ,  peace  is  said  to  be  the  cause.
When  a  man  ceases  to  have  any  attachment  either  for  the  objects  of  senses  or  for  actions ,  and  has  renounced  all  thoughts  of  the  world ,  he  is  said  to  have  climbed  to  the  heights  of  Yoga.
One  should  lift  oneself  by  one’s  own  efforts  and  should  not  degrade  oneself;  for  one’s  own  self  is  one’s  friend ,  and  one’s  own  self  is  one’s  enemy.
One’s  own  self  is  the  friend  of  the  soul  by  whom  the  lower  selfhas  been  conquered;  even  so  the  very  self  of  him  who  has  not  conquered  his  lower  self  behaves  antagonistically  like  an  enemy.
The  Supreme  Spirit  is  rooted  in  the  knowledge  of  the  self-controlled  man  whose  mind  is  perfectly  serene  in  the  midst  of  pairs  of  opposites ,  such  as  cold  and  heat ,  joy  and  sorrow ,  and  honour  and  ignominy.
The  Yogi  whose  heart  is  fully  satisfied  with  both  Jñanaand  Vijñana ,  who  is  steady  and  free  from  delusion ,  who  has  mastered  his  senses ,  and  to  whom  earth ,  stone ,  and  gold  are  alike—such  a  Yogi  is  said  to  be  united  with  God.
He  who  looks  upon  well-wishers  and  neutrals  as  well  as  mediators ,  friends  and  foes ,  relatives  and  objects  of  hatred ,  the  virtuous  and  the  sinful  with  the  same  eye ,  stand  supreme.
Living  in  seclusion  all  by  himself ,  the  Yogi  who  has  controlled  his  mind  and  body ,  and  is  free  from  desires  and  void  of  possessions ,  should  constantly  engage  his  mind  in  meditation.
In  a  clean  place ,  having  established  a  steady  seat  for  himself ,  neither  too  high  nor  too  low ,  covered  with  kusha  grass ,  deer  skin ,  and  cloth—
And  occupying  that  seat ,  concentrating  the  mind  and  controlling  the  functions  of  the  mind  and  senses ,  he  should  practise  Yoga  for  self-purification.
Holding  the  trunk ,  head  and  neck  straight  and  steady ,  remaining  firm  and  fixing  the  gaze  on  the  tip  of  his  nose ,  without  looking  in  other  direction.
Firm  in  the  vow  of  complete  chastity  and  fearless ,  keeping  himself  perfectly  calm  and  with  the  mind  held  in  restraint  and  fixed  on  Me ,  the  vigilant  Yogi  should  sit  absorbed  in  Me.
Thus  constantly  applying  his  mind  to  Me ,  the  Yogi  of  disciplined  mind  attains  the  everlasting  peace ,  consisting  of  supreme  bliss ,  which  abides  in  Me.
Arjuna ,  this  Yoga  is  neither  for  him  who  eats  too  much ,  nor  for  him  who  eats  too  little;  neither  for  him  who  sleeps  too  much ,  nor  for  him  who  is  always  awake.
Yoga ,  which  rids  one  of  woe ,  is  accomplished  only  by  him  who  is  regulated  in  diet  and  recreation ,  regulated  in  performing  actions ,  and  regulated  in  sleep  and  wakefulness.
When  the  mind  which  is  thoroughly  disciplined  gets  riveted  on  God  alone ,  then  the  person  who  is  free  from  yearning  for  all  enjoyments  is  said  to  be  established  in  Yoga.
As  a  light  does  not  flicker  in  a  windless  place ,  such  is  stated  to  be  the  picture  of  the  disciplined  mind  of  the  Yogi  practising  meditation  on  God.
When  the  mind  which  is  thoroughly  disciplined  gets  riveted  on  God  alone ,  then  the  person  who  is  free  from  yearning  for  all  enjoyments  is  said  to  be  established  in  Yoga.
Nay ,  in  which  the  soul  experience  the  eternal  and  supersensuous  job  which  can  be  apprehended  only  through  the  subtle  and  purified  intellect ,  and  wherein  established  the  said  Yogi  moves  not  from  Truth  on  any  account.
And  having  obtained  which  he  does  not  reckon  any  other  gain  as  greater  than  that ,  and  established  in  which  he  is  not  shaken  even  by  the  heaviest  of  sorrows.
That  state ,  called  Yoga ,  which  is  free  from  the  contact  of  sorrow ,  should  be  known.  Nay ,  this  Yoga  should  be  resolutely  practiced  with  an  unwearied  mind.
Completely  renouncing  all  desires  arising  from  thoughts  of  the  world ,  and  fully  restraining  the  whole  pack  of  the  senses  from  all  sides  by  the  time.
Gradually ,  with  the  mind  fixed  on  the  Supreme ,  and  with  firm  determination ,  one  should  not  think  of  anything  else.
Drawing  back  the  restless  and  fidgety  mind  from  all  those  objects  after  which  it  runs ,  he  should  repeatedly  fix  it  on  God.
Because  the  yogi  whose  mind  is  very  peaceful ,  who  is  free  from  sin  and  whose  passionis  calmed ,  attains  the  highest  happiness ,  the  state  of  Brahman ,  free  from  all  impurities.
The  sinless  Yogi ,  thus  uniting  his  self  constantly  with  God ,  easily  enjoys  the  eternal  Bliss  of  oneness  with  Brahma.
The  Yogi  who  is  united  in  identity  with  the  all-pervading ,  infinite  Consciousness;  and  sees  unity  everywhere ,  beholds  the  Self  present  in  all  beings ,  and  all  beings  as  assumed  in  the  Self.
He  who  sees  Mepresent  in  all  beings ,  and  all  beings  existing  within  Me ,  never  loses  sight  of  Me ,  and  I  never  lose  sight  of  him.
The  Yogi  who  is  established  in  union  with  Me ,  and  worships  Me  as  residing  in  all  beings;  abides  in  Me;  no  matter  what  he  does.
Arjuna ,  he  who  looks  on  all  as  one ,  on  the  analogy  of  his  own  self ,  and  looks  upon  the  joy  and  sorrow  of  all  with  a  similar  eye ,—such  a  Yogi  is  deemed  the  highest  of  all.
Arjuna  said:  Krishna ,  owing  to  restlessness  of  mind  I  do  not  perceive  the  stability  of  this  Yoga  in  the  form  of  equability ,  which  You  have  just  spoken  of.
For  Krishna ,  the  mind  is  very  unsteady ,  turbulent ,  tenacious  and  powerful  therefore ,  I  consider  it  as  difficult  to  control  as  the  wind.
Shree  Bhagavan  said:  The  mind  is  restless  no  doubt;  and  difficult  to  curb ,  Arjuna;  but  it  can  be  brought  under  control  by  repeated  practiceand  by  the  exercise  of  dispassion ,  O  son  of  Kunti.
My  opinion  is  that  yoga  is  painful  for  one  whose  mind  is  uncontrolled;  but  for  one  whose  mind  is  controlled ,  it  is  possible  to  attain  yoga  without  any  difficulty.  Yoga  is  difficult  of  achievement  for  one  whose  mind  is  not  subdued;  by  him;  however  who  has  the  mind  under  control ,  and  is  ceaselessly  striving ,  it  can  be  easily  attained  through  practice.  Such  is  My  conviction.
Arjuna  said:  Krishna ,  what  becomes  of  the  soul  who ,  though  endowed  with  faith ,  has  not  been  able  to  subdue  his  passions ,  and  whose  mind  is  therefore  diverted  from  Yoga ,  and  who  thus  fails  to  reach  perfection  in  Yoga?
Krishna ,  strayed  from  the  path  leading  to  God-Realization  and  without  anything  to  stand  upon ,  is  he  not  lost  like  the  torn  cloud ,  deprived  of  both  God-Realization  and  heavenly  enjoyment?
Krishna ,  it  behoves  You  to  slash  this  doubt  of  mine  completely;  for  none  other  than  You  can  be  found ,  who  can  tear  this  doubt.
Shree  Bhagavan  said:  Dear  Arjuna ,  there  is  no  fall  for  him  either  here  or  herafter.  For  none  who  strives  for  self-redemptionever  meets  with  evil  destiny.
Having  attained  the  worlds  of  the  righteous ,  the  virtuous  dwell  there  for  a  long  time ,  and  then  the  fallen  yogi  is  born  again  in  the  house  of  the  pure  and  prosperous.
Orhe  is  born  in  the  family  of  enlightened  Yogis;  but  such  a  birth  in  this  world  is  very  difficult  to  obtain.
There  he  attains  the  union  of  intellect ,  born  of  the  merits  of  past  lives;  and  then  he  strives  again ,  O  Kurunandana ,  for  perfection.
The  other  one ,  though  under  the  sway  of  his  senses ,  feels  drawn  towards  God  by  force  of  the  habit  acquired  in  his  previous  birth;  nay ,  even  the  seeker  of  enlightenment  on  Yogatranscends  the  fruit  of  actions  performed  with  some  interested  motive  as  laid  down  in  the  vedas.
The  Yogi ,  however ,  who  dilligently  takes  up  the  practice  attains  perfection  in  this  very  life  with  the  help  of  latencies  of  many  births ,  and  being  thoroughly  purged  of  sin ,  forthwith  reaches  the  supreme  state.
The  yogi  is  superior  to  the  ascetics;  he  is  regarded  as  superior  even  to  those  versed  in  sacred  lore.  The  Yogi  is  also  superior  to  those  who  perform  action  with  some  interested  motive.  Therefore ,  Arjuna ,  do  you  become  a  Yogi.
Of  all  Yogis ,  again ,  he  who  devoutly  worship  Me  with  his  mind  focussed  on  Me  is  considered  by  Me  to  be  the  best  Yogi.
Shree  Bhagavan  said:  Arjuna ,  now  listen  how  with  the  mind  attached  to  Meand  practising  Yoga  with  absolute  dependence  on  Me ,  you  will  know  Me  (the
I  shall  unfold  to  you  in  its  entirety  this  wisdomalong  with  the  Knowledge  of  the  qualified  aspect  of  God ,  having  known  which  nothing  else  remains  yet  to  be  known  in  this  world.
Among  thousands  of  men ,  one  strives  for  perfection;  and  among  those  who  have  achieved  perfection ,  hardly  one  knows  Me  in  truth.
Earth ,  water ,  fire ,  air ,  ether ,  mind ,  reason  and  also  ego;  these  constitute  My  nature  eightfold.
This  indeed  is  My  lowernature;  the  other  than  this ,  by  which  the  whole  universe  is  sustained ,  know  it  to  be  My  highernature  in  the  form  of  Jiva ,  O  Arjuna.
Arjuna ,  know  that  all  beings  have  evolved  from  this  twofold  Prakrti ,  and  that  I  am  the  source  of  the  entire  creation ,  and  into  Me  again  it  disappears.
There  is  nothing  else  besides  Me ,  Arjuna.  Like  clusters  of  yarn-beads  formed  by  knots  on  a  thread ,  all  this  is  threaded  on  Me.
Arjuna ,  I  am  the  sapidity  in  water  and  the  light  of  the  moon  and  the  sun;  I  am  the  sacred  syllable  OM  in  all  the  Vedas ,  the  sound  in  ether;  and  the  manliness  in  men.
I  am  the  pure  odourin  the  earth  and  the  brilliance  in  fire;  nay ,  I  am  the  life  in  all  beings  and  the  austerity  in  men  of  askesis.
Arjuna ,  know  Me  the  eternal  seed  of  all  beings.  I  am  the  intelligence  of  the  intelligent;  the  glory  of  the  glorious  am  I.
O  best  of  the  Bharatas ,  I  am  the  strength  of  the  strong ,  devoid  of  desire  and  passion;  and  I  am  the  desire  in  beings ,  not  opposed  to  dharma.
Whatever  other  entities  there  are ,  born  of  Sattva ,  and  those  that  are  born  of  Rajasand  Tamas ,  know  them  all  as  evolved  from  Me  alone.  In  reality ,  however ,  neither  do  I  exist  in  them ,  nor  they  in  Me.
The  whole  of  this  creation  is  deluded  by  these  objects  evolved  from  the  three  modes  of  Prakrti-Sattva ,  Rajas  and  Tamas;  that  is  why  the  world  fails  to  recognize  Me ,  standing  apart  from  these  and  imperishable.
This  divine  energy  of  Mine ,  consisting  of  the  three  modes  of  material  nature ,  is  difficult  to  overcome.  But  those  who  have  surrendered  unto  Me  alone  can  cross  beyond  it.
Those  whose  wisdom  has  been  carried  away  by  Maya ,  and  who  have  embraced  the  demoniac  nature ,  such  foolish  and  vile  men  of  evil  deeds  do  not  adore  Me.
Four  types  of  devotees  of  noble  deeds  worship  Me ,  Arjuna ,  the  seeker  after  worldly  possessions ,  the  afflicted ,  the  seeker  for  knowledge ,  and  man  of  wisdom ,  O  best  of  Bharatas.
Of  these  best  is  the  man  of  wisdom ,  ever  established  in  indentity  with  Me  and  possessed  of  exclusive  devotion.  For  I  am  extremely  dear  to  the  wise  man ,  and  he  is  extremely  dear  to  me.
Indeed  all  these  are  noble ,  but  the  man  of  wisdom  is  My  very  self:  such  is  My  view.  For  such  a  devotee ,  who  has  his  mind  and  intellect  merged  in  Me ,  is  firmly  established  in  Me  alone ,  the  highest  goal.
In  the  very  last  of  all  births  the  enlightened  soul  worships  Me ,  realizing  that  all  this  is  God.  Such  a  great  soul  is  very  rare.
Those  whose  wisdom  has  been  carried  away  by  various  desires ,  being  prompted  by  their  own  nature ,  worship  other  deities  adopting  rules  relating  to  each.
Whatever  celestial  form  a  devoteeworships  with  faith ,  I  make  that  faith  of  his  steady.
Endowed  with  such  faith  he  worship  that  particular  deity  and  obtains  through  him  without  doubt  his  desired  enjoyments  as  ordained  by  Myself.
But  the  results  of  their  worship  are  limited  and  perishable;  those  who  worship  the  gods  go  to  the  gods ,  but  My  devotees  ultimately  come  to  Me.
Not  knowing  My  unsurpassable  and  undecaying  supreme  nature ,  the  ignorant  believe  Me ,  the  supreme  Spirit  beyond  the  reach  of  mind  and  senses ,  the  embodiment  of  Truth ,  Knowledge  and  Bliss ,  to  have  assumed  a  finite  form  through  birth.
Veiled  by  My  Yogamaya;  I  am  not  manifest  to  all.  Hence  these  ignorant  folk  fail  to  recognize  Me ,  the  unborn  and  imperishable  Supreme  Deity.
Arjuna ,  I  know  all  beings ,  past  as  well  as  present ,  nay ,  even  those  that  are  yet  to  come;  but  noneknows  Me.
O  valiant  Arjuna ,  through  delusion  in  the  shape  of  pairs  of  opposites ,  born  of  desire  and  hatred ,  all  living  creatures  in  this  world  are  falling  a  prey  to  infatuation.
But  those  who  have  their  sins  destroyed  by  performing  the  best  actions  without  attachment ,  they ,  freed  from  delusion  born  of  desire  and  hatred ,  worship  Me  with  firm  determination.
They  who ,  having  taken  refuge  in  Me ,  strive  for  deliverance  from  old  age  and  death  know  Brahma ,  the  whole  Adhyatma ,  and  the  entire  field  of  Karma.
They  who ,  possessed  of  a  steadfast  mind ,  know  Me  as  comprising  Adhibhuta ,  Adhidaivaand  Adhiyajna ,  know  Me  even  at  the  hour  of  death.
Arjuna  said:  Krishna ,  what  is  that  Brahma ,  what  is  Adhyatma ,  and  what  is  Karma?  What  is  called  Adhibhutaand  what  is  termed  as  Adhidaiva?
Krishna ,  who  is  Adhiyajña  here  and  how  does  he  dwell  in  the  body?  And  how  are  You  to  be  realized  at  the  time  of  death  by  those  of  steadfast  mind?
Shree  Bhagavan  said:  The  supreme  Indestructible  is  Brahma;  one’s  own  selfis  called  Adhyatma;  and  the  cause  of  the  origin  of  beings  is  called  Karma.
All  perishable  objects  are  Adhibhuta;  the  shining  Purushais  Adhidaiva;  and  in  this  body  I  Myself ,  dwelling  as  the  inner  witness ,  am  Adhiyajña ,  O  Arjuna!
Whoever ,  at  the  time  of  death ,  remembering  Me  alone ,  quits  his  body ,  he  attains  My  being;  there  is  no  doubt  about  this.
Arjuna ,  thinking  of  whatever  entity  one  leaves  the  body  at  the  time  of  death ,  that  and  that  alone  one  attains ,  being  ever  absorbed  in  its  thought.
Therefore ,  Arjuna ,  at  all  times  remember  Me  and  fight.  With  your  mind  and  intellect  dedicated  to  Me ,  you  will  surely  come  to  Me  without  doubt.
Arjuna ,  he  who  with  his  mind  disciplined  through  Yoga  in  the  form  of  practice  of  meditation  and  thinking  of  nothing  else ,  is  constantly  engaged  in  contemplation  of  God  attains  the  supremely  effulgent  divine  Purusha.
He  who  contemplates  on  the  all-wise ,  ageless  Being ,  the  Ruler  of  all ,  subtler  than  the  subtle ,  the  universal  sustainer ,  possessing  a  Form  beyond  human  conception ,  refulgent  like  the  sun  and  far  beyond  the  darkness  of  ignorance.
At  the  time  of  departure ,  with  a  mind  steady  in  devotion  and  united  by  the  strength  of  yoga ,  firmly  establishing  the  life  force  in  the  middle  of  the  eyebrows ,  one  attains  that  supreme  divine  person.
I  shall  tell  you  briefly  about  that  supreme  goal ,  which  the  knowers  of  the  Veda  term  as  the  Indestructible;  which  striving  recluses  free  from  passion  enter ,  and
Having  closed  all  the  doors  of  the  senses ,  and  firmly  holding  the  mind  in  the  cavity  of  the  heart ,  and  then  fixing  the  life-breath  in  the  head ,  and  thus  remaining  steadfast  in  Yogic  concentration  on  God ,  he  who  leaves  the  body  and  departs  uttering  the  one  indestructible  Brahma ,  Om ,  and  dwelling  on  Me  in  My  absolute  aspect ,  reaches  the  supreme  goal.
Uttering  the  one-syllabled  Om  the  Brahman  and  remembering  Me ,  he  who  departs ,  leaving  the  body ,  attains  to  the  Supreme  Goal.
Arjuna ,  whosoever  always  and  constantly  thinks  of  Me  with  undivided  mind ,  to  that  Yogi  ever  absorbed  in  Me  I  am  easily  attainable.
Having  attained  Me ,  the  great  souls  who  have  reached  the  supreme  perfection  do  not  take  birth  again  in  this  miserable  and  temporary  world.
Great  souls ,  who  have  attained  the  highest  perfection ,  having  come  to  Me ,  are  no  more  subjected  to  rebirth ,  which  is  the  abode  of  sorrow ,  and  transient  by  nature.
Those  Yogis  who  know  from  realization  Brahma’s  day  as  covering  a  thousand  Mahayugas ,  and  his  night  as  ending  in  a  thousand  Mahayugas ,  know  the  reality  about  time.
All  embodied  beings  emanate  from  the  Unmanifestat  the  coming  of  the  cosmic  day;  at  the  cosmic  nightfall  they  merge  into  the  same  subtle  body  of  Brahma ,  known  as  the  Unmanifest.
Arjuna ,  this  multitude  of  beings ,  being  born  again  and  again ,  is  dissolved  under  compulsion  of  its  nature  at  the  coming  of  the  cosmic  night ,  and  rises  again  at  the  commencement  of  the  cosmic  day.
Beyond  that  is  another ,  beyond  the  unmanifest ,  the  eternal  unmanifested.  He  is  the  Supreme  Divine  Person  who  does  not  perish  even  when  all  beings  perish.
The  same  Unmanifest  which  has  been  spoken  of  as  the  Indestructible  is  also  called  the  supreme  Goal;  that  again  is  My  supreme  Abode ,  attaining  which  they  return  not  to  this  mortal  world.
Arjuna ,  that  eternal  unmanifest  supreme  Purusha  in  whom  all  beings  reside ,  and  by  whom  all  this  is  pervaded ,  is  attainable  only  through  exclusive  Devotion.
Arjuna ,  I  shall  now  tell  you  the  timedeparting  when  Yogis  do  not  return ,  and  the  time  when  they  do  return;  I  shall  explain  both ,  O  best  of  the  Bharatas.
the  one  is  that  which  are  stationed  the  all-effulgent  fire-god  and  the  deities  presiding  over  daylight ,  the  bright  fortnight ,  and  the  six  months  of  the  northward  course  of  the  sun  respectively;  proceeding  along  it  after  death  Yogis ,  who  have  known  Brahma ,  being  successively  led  by  the  above  gods ,  finally  reach  Brahma.
The  other  path  is  that  wherein  are  stationed  the  gods  presiding  over  smoke ,  night ,  the  dark  fortnight ,  and  the  six  months  of  the  southward  course  of  the  sun;  the  Yogitaking  to  this  path  after  death  is  led  by  the  above  gods ,  one  after  another ,  and  attaining  the  lustre  of  the  moonreturns  to  this  mortal  world.
For  these  two  paths  of  the  world ,  the  bright  and  the  dark ,  are  considered  to  be  eternal.  Proceeding  by  one  of  them ,  one  reaches  the  supreme  state  from  which  there  is  no  return;  and  proceeding  by  the  other ,  one  returns  to  the  mortal  world ,  i.e. ,  becomes  subject  to  birth  and  death  once  more.
Knowing  thus  the  secret  of  these  two  paths ,  O  son  of  Kunti ,  no  Yogi  gets  deluded.  Therefore ,  Arjuna ,  at  all  times  be  steadfast  in  Yoga  in  the  form  of  equanimity.
The  Yogi ,  realizing  this  profound  truth ,  doubtless  transcends  all  the  rewards ,  ascribed  in  the  scriptures  to  the  study  of  the  Vedas ,  as  well  as  to  the  performance  of  sacrifices ,  austerities  and  charities ,  and  attains  the  beginningless  supreme  state.
Shree  Bhagavan  said:  To  you ,  who  are  devoid  of  the  carping  spirit ,  I  shall  now  unfold  the  most  secret  knowledge  of  Nirguna  Brahma  along  with  the  knowledge  of  manifest  Divinity ,  knowing  which  you  shall  be  free  from  the  evil  of  worldly  existence.
This  knowledge  of  both  the  Nirguna  and  Saguna  aspects  of  Divinity  is  a  sovereign  science ,  a  sovereign  secret ,  supremely  holy ,  most  excellent ,  directly  enjoyable ,  attended  with  virtue ,  very  easy  to  practise  and  imperishable.
O  Arjuna ,  those  who  have  no  faith  in  this  dharma ,  O  conqueror  of  enemies ,  they  do  not  attain  Me ,  but  return  to  the  cycle  of  birth  and  death.
The  whole  of  this  universe  is  permeated  by  Me  as  unmanifest  Divinity ,  and  all  beings  rest  on  the  idea  within  Me.  Therefore ,  really  speaking ,  I  am  not  present  in  them.
Not  in  beings  do  I  abide ,  behold  My  divine  Yoga  power.  I  am  the  sustainer  and  creator  of  beings ,  yet  My  Self  is  not  in  them.
Just  as  the  extensive  air ,  which  is  moving  everywhere ,ever  remains  in  ether ,  likewise  know  that  all  beingsabide  in  Me.
Arjuna ,  during  the  Final  Dissolution  all  beings  enter  My  Prakrti ,  and  at  the  beginning  of  creation ,  I  send  them  forth  again.
Wielding  My  Nature  I  release ,  again  and  again ,all  this  multitude  of  beings  subject  to  the  influence  of  their  own  nature.
Arjuna ,  those  actions ,  however ,  do  not  bind  Me ,  unattached  as  I  am  to  such  actions  and  standing  apart  as  it  were.
Arjuna;  with  Me  as  the  supervisor ,  Nature  brings  forth  the  whole  creation ,  consisting  of  both  sentient  and  insentient  beings;  it  is  due  to  this  cause  that  the  wheel  of  Samsara  is  going  round.
Fools ,  not  knowing  My  supreme  nature ,  think  low  of  Me ,  the  Overlord  of  the  entire  creation ,  who  have  put  on  the  human  semblance..
Those  who  have  deluded  minds ,  engaged  in  fruitless  hopes ,  fruitless  actions ,  and  fruitless  knowledge ,  are  attached  to  the  demonic ,  demoniac ,  and  deluding  modes  of  nature.
On  the  other  hand ,  Arjuna ,  great  souls  who  have  embraced  the  divine  nature ,  knowing  Me  as  the  prime  source  of  all  lives  and  the  imperishable  eternal ,  worship  Me  constantly  with  none  else  in  mind.
Constantly  chanting  My  names  and  glories  and  striving  for  My  realization ,  and  bowing  again  and  again  to  Me ,  those  devotees  of  firm  resolve ,  ever  united  with  Me  through  meditation ,  worship  Me  with  single-minded  devotion.
Otherbetake  themselves  to  Me  through  their  offering  of  Knowledge ,  worshipping  Mewith  undivided  devotion ,  and  others  worship  Me  in  many  different  ways  as  the  Viratform  of  the  Supreme  Lord.
I  am  the  Vedic  ritual ,  I  am  the  sacrifice ,  I  am  the  offering  to  the  departed;  I  am  the  herbage  and  foodgrains;  I  am  the  sacred  formula ,  I  am  the  clarified  butter ,  I  am  the  sacred  fire ,  and  I  am  verily  the  act  of  offering  oblations  into  the  fire.
I  am  the  father  of  this  world ,  the  mother ,  the  support ,  and  the  grandsire;  I  am  the  object  of  knowledge ,  the  purifier ,  the  syllable  Om;  I  am  the  Rig ,  Sama ,  and  Yajur  Vedas.
I  am  the  supreme  goal ,  supporter ,  lord ,  witness ,  abode ,  refuge ,  wellwisher  seeking  no  return ,  origin  and  end ,  resting-place ,  storehouse ,  and  imperishable  seed.
I  radiate  heat  as  the  sun ,  and  hold  back  as  well  as  send  forth  showers ,  Arjuna.  I  am  immortality  as  well  as  death;  even  so  I  am  being  and  non-being  both.
Those  who  perform  sacrifices  with  faith ,  drinking  soma  and  free  from  sin ,  desire  to  reach  heaven  by  worshiping  Me.  They  attain  the  world  of  the  gods  and  enjoy  divine  pleasures  there.
Having  enjoyed  the  extensive  heaven-world ,  they  return  to  this  world  of  mortals  on  the  stock  of  their  merits  being  exhausted.  Thus  devoted  to  the  ritual  with  interested  motive  recommended  by  the  three  Vedas ,  and  seeking  worldly  enjoyments ,  they  repeatedly  come  and  go
The  devotees ,  however ,  who  loving  no  one  else  constantly  think  of  Me ,  and  worship  Me  in  a  disinterested  spirit ,  to  those  ever  united  in  thought  with  Me  I  bring  full  security  and  personally  attend  to  their  needs.
The  devotees  who  worship  the  gods  with  faith  and  perform  sacrifices ,  they  also  worship  Me ,  O  son  of  Kunti ,  performing  their  duties  in  the  prescribed  manner.
For  I  am  the  enjoyer  and  also  the  lord  of  all  sacrifices;  but  they  know  Me  not  in  reality ,  hence  they  fall.
Those  who  are  vowed  to  gods  go  to  the  gods;  those  who  are  vowed  to  the  manes  reach  the  manes;  those  who  adore  the  spirits  reach  the  spirits  and  those  who  worship  Me  come  to  Me  alone..
Whoever  offers  Me  with  devotion  a  leaf ,  a  flower ,  a  fruit ,  or  water ,  I  accept  that  pure-hearted  devotee’s  offering  with  love.
Arjuna ,  whatever  you  do ,  whatever  you  eat ,  whatever  you  offer  as  oblation  to  the  sacred  fire ,  whatever  you  bestow  as  a  gift ,  whatever  you  do  by  way  of  penance ,  offer  it  all  to  Me.
Thus ,  the  soul  who  is  devoted  to  Me ,  renouncing  the  fruits  of  all  actions ,  is  freed  from  bondage  to  work  and  attains  liberation.
I  am  equally  present  in  all  beings;  there  is  none  hateful  or  dear  to  Me.  They ,  however ,  who  devoutly  worship  Me  abide  in  Me;  and  I  too  stand  revealed  in  them.
Even  if  one  commits  the  worst  deeds ,  if  he  worships  Me  with  exclusive  devotion ,  he  should  be  considered  righteous ,  for  he  is  rightly  resolved.
Speedily  he  becomes  virtuous  and  secures  lasting  peace.  Know  it  for  certain ,  Arjuna ,  that  My  devotee  never  falls.
Arjuna ,  women ,  VaisyasSudras ,  as  well  as  those  of  vile  birth ,  whoever  they  may  be ,  taking  refuge  in  Me  they  too  attain  the  supreme  goal.
How  much  more ,  then ,  holy  Brahmanas  and  royal  sages  devoted  to  Me!  Therefore ,  having  obtained  this  joyless  and  transient  human  life ,  constantly  worship  Me.
Fix  your  mind  on  Me ,  be  devoted  to  Me ,  worship  Me  and  make  obeisance  to  Me;  thus  linking  yourself  with  Me  and  entirely  depending  on  Me ,  you  shall  come  to  Me.
Shree  Bhagavan  said:  Arjuna ,  hear  once  again  My  supreme  word ,  which  I  shall  speak  to  you ,  who  are  so  loving ,  out  of  solicitude  for  your  welfare.
Neither  gods  nor  the  great  sages  know  the  secret  of  My  birth;  for  I  am  the  prime  cause  in  all  respects  of  gods  as  well  as  of  the  great  seers.
He  who  knows  Me  in  reality  as  birthless  and  without  beginning ,  and  as  the  supreme  Lord  of  the  Universe ,  he ,  undeluded  among  men ,  is  purged  of  all  sins.
Reason ,  right  knowledge ,  unclouded  understanding ,  forbearance ,  veracity ,  control  over  the  senses  and  mind ,  joy  and  sorrow ,  evolution  and  dissolution ,  fear  and  fearlessness—these  diverse  traits  of  creatures  emanate  from  me  alone.
Non-violence ,  equanimity ,  contentment ,  austerity ,  charity ,  fame  and  obloquy—these  diverse  traits  of  creatures  emanate  from  me  alone.
Seven  great  sages ,  four  ancient  Manus ,  and  the  fourteen  progenitors  including  Sanaka  and  others ,  all  these  beings  with  minds  born  of  me ,  have  arisen  by  my  will;  their  progeny  fills  the  world.
He  who  knows  in  reality  this  supreme  divine  glory  and  supernatural  power  of  Mine  gets  established  in  Me  through  unfaltering  Devotion;  of  this  there  is  no  doubt.
I  am  the  origin  of  all;  everything  proceeds  from  Me.  Understanding  this ,  the  wise  worship  Me  with  devotion.
With  their  mind  fixed  on  Me ,  and  their  lives  surrendered  to  Me ,  enlightening  one  another  about  My  greatness  and  speaking  of  Me ,  My  devotees  ever  remain  contented  and  take  delight  in  Me.
On  those  ever  united  through  meditation ,  with  Me  and  worshipping  Me  with  love ,  I  confer  that  Yoga  of  wisdom  through  which  they  come  to  Me.
In  order  to  shower  My  grace  on  them  I ,  dwelling  in  their  heart ,  dispel  the  darkness  born  of  ignorance  by  the  shining  light  of  wisdom.
Arjuna  said:  You  are  the  transcendent  Eternal ,  the  supreme  Abode  and  the  greatest  purifier;  all  the  seers  speak  of  You  as  the  eternal  divine  Purusha ,  the  primal  Deity ,  unborn  and  all-pervading.
Likewise  speak  the  celestial  sage  Narada ,  the  sages  Asita  and  Devala  and  the  great  sage  Vyasa;  and  Yourself  too  proclaim  this  to  me.
Krishna ,  I  believe  as  true  all  that  You  tell  me ,  Lord ,  neither  demons  nor  gods  are  aware  of  Your  manifestation  through  sport.
O  creator  of  beings ,  O  Ruler  of  creatures ,  O  God  of  gods ,  the  Lord  of  the  universe ,  O  supreme  Purusha ,  You  alone  know  what  You  are  by  Yourself.
Therefore ,  You  alone  can  describe  in  full  Your  divine  glories ,  whereby  You  stand  pervading  all  these  worlds.
O  Master  of  Yoga ,  through  what  process  of  continuous  meditation  shall  I  know  You?  And  in  what  particular  forms ,  O  Lord ,  are  You  to  be  meditated  upon  by  me?
Krishna ,  tell  me  once  more  in  detail  Your  power  of  Yoga  and  Your  glory;  for  I  know  no  satiety  in  hearing  Your  nectar-like  words.
Shree  Bhagavan  said:  Arjuna ,  now  I  shall  tell  you  My  conspicuous  divine  glories;  for  there  is  no  limit  to  My  magnitude.
Arjuna  I  am  the  universal  Self  seated  in  the  heart  of  all  beings;  so  I  alone  am  the  beginning  and  middle  and  also  the  end  of  all  beings.
I  am  Visnu  among  the  twelve  sons  of  Aditi ,  and  the  radiant  sun  among  the  luminaries;  I  am  the  glow  of  the  Maruts ,  and  the  moon  among  the  stars.
Among  the  Vedas ,  I  am  the  Samaveda;  among  the  gods ,  I  am  Indra.  Among  the  organs  of  perception  etc. ,  I  am  the  mind;  and  I  am  the  consciousnessin  living  beings.
Among  the  eleven  Rudras;  I  am  Siva;  and  among  the  Yaksas  and  Raksasas;  I  am  the  Lord  of  riches.  Among  the  eight  Vasus ,  I  am  the  god  of  fire:  and  among  the  mountains ,  I  am  the  Meru.
Among  the  priests ,  Arjuna ,  know  Me  to  be  their  chief ,  Brhaspati.  Among  warrior-chiefs ,  I  am  Skanda;  and  among  the  waters;  I  am  the  ocean.
Among  the  great  seers ,  I  am  Bhrgu;  among  words ,  I  am  the  sacred  syllable  OM.  Among  offerings ,  I  am  the  offering  of  Japa;  and  among  the  immovables ,  the  Himalaya.
Among  all  trees ,  I  am  the  Asvattha;  among  the  celestial  sages ,  Narada;  among  the  Gandharvas ,  Citraratha;  and  among  the  Siddhas ,  I  am  the  sage  Kapila.
Among  horses ,  know  Me  to  be  the  celestial  horse  Uccaihsrava ,  begotten  of  the  churning  of  the  ocean  along  with  nectar;  among  mighty  elephants  Airavata;  and  among  men ,  the  king.
Among  weapons ,  I  am  the  thunderbolt;  among  cows ,  I  am  the  celestial  cow  Kamadhenu.  I  am  the  sexual  desire  which  leads  to  procreation;  among  serpents ,  I  am  Vasuki.
Among  Nagas ,  I  am  the  serpent-god  Ananta;  and  I  am  Varuna ,  the  lord  of  aquatic  creatures.  Among  the  manes ,  I  am  Aryama ,  and  among  rulers ,  I  am  Yama.
Among  the  Daityas ,  I  am  the  great  devotee  Prahlada;  and  among  reckoners ,  I  am  Time.  So  among  quadrupeds ,  I  am  the  lion;  and  among  birds ,  I  am  Garuda.
Among  purifiers ,  I  am  the  wind;  among  warriors ,  I  am  Shree  Rama.  Among  fishes ,  I  am  the  shark;  and  among  streams ,  I  am  the  Ganges.
Arjuna ,  I  am  the  beginning  and  the  middle  and  the  end  of  all  creations.  Of  sciences ,  I  am  the  science  of  the  soul ,  or  metaphysics;  in  disputants ,  I  am  the  right  type  of  reasoning.
Among  the  sounds  represented  by  the  various  letters ,  I  am  ‘A’;  of  the  different  kinds  of  compounds  in  grammar ,  I  am  the  copulative  compound.  I  am  verily  the  endless  Time;  I  am  the  sustainer  of  all ,  having  My  face  on  all  sides.
I  am  the  all-destroying  Death  that  snatches  all ,  and  the  origin  of  all  that  shall  be  born.  Among  women ,  I  am  Kirti ,  Shree ,  Vak ,  Smrti ,  Medha ,  Dhrti  and  Ksama.
Likewise  among  the  Srutis  that  can  be  sung ,  I  am  the  variety  known  as  Brhatsama;  while  among  the  Vedic  hymns ,  I  am  the  hymn  known  as  Gayatri.  Again ,  among  the  twelve  months  of  the  Hindu  calendar;  I  am  the  month  Margasirsha  and  among  the  seasons ,  I  am  the  spring.
I  am  gambling  among  deceitful  practices ,  and  the  glory  of  the  glorious.  I  am  the  victory  of  the  victorious ,  the  resolve  of  the  resolute ,  the  goodness  of  the  good.
Among  the  Vrishnis  I  am  Vasudeva ,  among  the  Pandavas  I  am  Dhananjaya;  among  the  sages  I  am  Vyasa ,  and  among  poets  I  am  the  poet  Ushanas.
I  am  the  subduing  power  in  rulers;  I  am  righteousness  in  those  who  seek  to  conquer.  Of  things  to  be  kept  secret ,  I  am  the  custodian  in  the  shape  of  reticence;  and  I  am  the  wisdom  of  the  wise.
Arjuna ,  I  am  even  that  which  is  the  seed  of  all  life.  For  there  is  no  creature ,  moving  or  inert ,  which  exists  without  Me.
Arjuna ,  there  is  no  limit  to  My  divine  manifestation.  This  is  only  a  brief  description  by  Me  of  the  extent  of  My  glory.
Whatever  is  endowed  with  existence ,  consciousness ,  and  glory ,  know  that  to  be  a  manifestation  of  a  part  of  My  splendor.
Or ,  what  will  you  gain  by  knowing  all  this  in  detail ,  Arjuna?  Suffice  it  to  say  that  I  stand  holding  this  entire  universe  by  a  fraction  of  My  Yogic  power.
Arjuna  said:  Thanks  to  the  most  profound  words  of  spiritual  wisdom  that  You  have  spoken  out  of  kindness  to  me ,  this  delusion  of  mine  has  entirely  disappeared.
Because ,  O  Lotus-eyed  one ,  I  have  heard  from  you  in  detail  about  the  origin  of  beings ,  and  now  I  shall  speak  about  your  greatness.
Your  divine  form  possessed  of  wisdom ,  glory ,  energy ,  strength ,  valour  and  effulgence ,  O  best  of  persons!
O  Lord ,  if  You  think  that  it  is  possible  for  me  to  behold  that  form  by  me ,  then  show  me  that  imperishable  form ,  O  Lord  of  Yoga.
Shree  Bhagavan  said:  Arjuna ,  behold  presently  in  hundreds  and  thousands ,  My  multifarious  divine  forms ,  of  various  colours  and  shapes.
Behold  in  Me  the  Adityas ,  the  Vasus ,  the  Rudras ,  the  two  Ashvins ,  and  also  the  Maruts ,  O  Bharata ,  and  many  wonders  never  seen  before.
Arjuna ,  behold  as  concentrated  within  this  body  of  Mine  the  entire  creation  consisting  of  both  animate  and  inanimate  beings ,  and  whatever  else  you  desire  to  see.
But  surely  you  cannot  see  Me  with  these  human  eyes  of  yours;  therefore ,  I  vouchsafe  to  you  the  divine  eye.  With  this  you  behold  My  divine  power  of  Yoga.
Sanjaya  said:  My  lord!  having  spoken  thus ,  Shree  Krishna ,  the  supreme  Master  of  Yoga ,  forthwith  revealed  to  Arjuna  His  supremely  glorious  divine  Form.
Arjuna  saw  the  supreme  Deity  possessing  many  mouths  and  eyes ,  presenting  many  a  wonderful  sight ,  decked  with  many  divine  ornaments ,  wielding  many  uplifted  divine  weapons ,
wearing  divine  garlands  and  clothes ,  besmeared  all  over  with  divine  sandal-pastes ,  full  of  all  wonders ,  infinite  and  having  faces  on  all  sides.
If  there  be  the  effulgence  of  a  thousand  suns  bursting  forth  all  at  once  in  the  heavens ,  even  that  would  hardly  approach  the  splendour  of  the  mighty  Lord.
Concentrated  at  one  place  in  the  person  of  that  supreme  Deity ,  Arjuna  then  beheld  the  whole  universe  with  its  manifold  divisions.
Then  Arjuna ,  full  of  wonder  and  with  the  hair  standing  on  end ,  reverentially  bowed  his  head  to  the  divine  Lord ,  and  with  joined  palms  addressed  Him  thus.
Arjuna  said—O  Lord!  I  see  in  Your  body  all  the  gods  and  also  the  hosts  of  various  beings ,  Brahma  seated  on  the  lotus ,  the  great  god  Shiva ,  and  all  the  sages  and  divine  serpents.
O  lord  of  the  universe ,  I  see  You  endowed  with  numerous  arms ,  bellies ,  mouths ,  and  eyes  and  having  innumerable  forms  extended  on  all  sides.  I  see  neither  Your  beginning  nor  middle ,  nor  even  Your  end ,  manifested  as  You  are  in  the  form  of  the  universe.
I  see  You  endowed  with  diadems ,  clubs  and  discuses ,  a  mass  of  splendour  flaming  all  round ,  having  the  brilliance  of  a  blazing  fire  and  the  sun ,  hard  to  gaze  at  and  immeasurable  on  all  sides.
You  are  the  supreme  indestructible  worthy  of  being  known;  You  are  the  ultimate  refuge  of  this  universe.  You  are ,  again ,  the  protector  of  the  ageless  Dharma;  I  consider  You  to  be  the  eternal  imperishable  Being.
I  see  You  without  beginning ,  middle  or  end ,  possessing  unlimited  prowess  and  endowed  with  numberless  arms ,  having  the  moon  and  the  sun  for  Your  eyes ,  and  blazing  fire  for  Your  mouth ,  and  scorching  this  universe  by  Your  radiance.
Yonder  space  between  heaven  and  earth  and  all  the  quarters  are  entirely  filled  by  You  alone.  Seeing  this  transcendent ,  dreadful  form  of  yours ,  O  sould  of  the  universe ,  all  the  three  worlds  feels  greatly  alarmed.
Yonder  hosts  of  gods  are  entering  You;  some  with  palms  joined  out  of  fear  are  uttering  Your  names  and  glories.  Multitudes  of  Maharsis  and  Siddhas ,  saying  ‘Let  there  be  peace’ ,  are  extolling  You  by  means  of  excellent  hymns.
The  eleven  Rudras ,  the  twelve  Adityas ,  the  eight  Vasus ,  the  Sadhyas ,  the  Visvedevas ,  the  Ashvins ,  the  Maruts ,  the  ancestors ,  the  Gandharvas ,  the  Yakshas ,  the  Rakshasas ,  and  the  Siddhas—all  are  looking  at  You  in  wonder.
Lord ,  seeing  this  stupendous  and  dreadful  Form  of  Yours  possessing  numerous  mouths  and  eyes ,  many  arms ,  thighs  and  feet ,  many  bellies  and  many  teeth ,  the  worlds  are  terror-struck;  so  am  I.
Because ,  O  Vishnu!  touching  the  sky ,  radiant ,  adorned  with  many  colors ,  with  spreading  mouths  and  large  luminous  eyes ,  seeing  You ,  my  inner  self  is  terrified;  I  cannot  maintain  my  composure  or  peace.
Seeing  Your  faces  frightful  on  account  of  their  teeth ,  and  flaring  like  the  fire  at  the  time  of  universal  destruction ,  I  am  utterly  bewildered  and  find  no  happiness;  therefore ,  be  kind  to  me ,  O  Lord  of  celestials  and  Resting-place  of  the  universe.
All  those  sons  of  Dhrtarastra  with  hosts  of  kings  are  entering  You.Bhishma ,  Drona  and  yonder  Karna ,  with  the  principal  warriors  on  our  side  as  well ,  are  rushing  headlong  into  Your  fearful  mouths.
Rushing  into  Your  fearful  mouths  looking  all  the  more  terrible  on  account  of  their  teeth ,  some  are  seen  stuck  up  in  the  gaps  between  Your  teeth  with  their  heads  crushed.
Just  as  many  swift  rivers ,  rushing  headlong ,  enter  the  ocean ,  so  do  these  heroes  of  the  human  world  enter  Your  blazing  mouths.  As  the  myriad  streams  of  rivers  rush  towards  the  sea  alone ,  so  do  those  warriors  of  the  mortal  world  enter  Your  flaming  mouths.
As  moths  rush  with  great  speed  into  the  blazing  fire  for  extinction  out  of  their  folly ,  even  so  all  these  people  are  with  great  rapidity  entering  Your  mouths  to  meet  their  doom.
Thou  lickest  up ,  devouring  all  the  worlds  on  every  side  with  Thy  flaming  mouths.  Thy  fierce  rays ,  filling  the  whole  world  with  radiance ,  are  burning ,  O  Vishnu!	
Tell  me  who  You  are  with  a  form  so  terrible.  My  obeisance  to  You ,  O  best  of  gods;  be  kind  to  me ,  I  wish  to  know  You ,  the  Primal  Being ,  in  particular;  for  I  know  not  Your  purpose.
Shree  Bhagavan  said:  I  am  inflamed  Kala ,  the  destroyer  of  the  worlds.  I  am  out  to  exterminate  these  people.  Even  without  you  all  those  warriors  arrayed  in  the  enemy’s  camp  must  die.
Therefore ,  arise ,  gain  fame ,  conquer  the  enemies ,  and  enjoy  a  prosperous  kingdom  with  wealth  and  resources.  These  brave  warriors  have  already  been  slain  by  Me.  O  Savyasachin ,  you  are  only  the  instrument.
Do  you  kill  Drona  andBhishma  and  Jayadratha  and  Karna  and  even  other  brave  warriors;  who  stand  already  killed  by  Me;  fear  not.  You  will  surely  conquer  the  enemies  in  this  war;  therefore ,  fight.
Sanjaya  said:  Hearing  these  words  of  Bhagavan  Keshava ,  Arjuna  tremblingly  bowed  to  Him  with  joined  palms ,  and  bowing  again  in  extreme  terror  spoke  to  Shree  Krishna  in  faltering  accents.
Arjuna  said:  Lord ,  well  it  is  the  universe  exults  and  is  filled  with  love  by  chanting  Your  names ,  virtues  and  glory;  terrified  Raksasas  are  fleeing  in  all  directions ,  and  all  the  hosts  of  Siddhas  are  bowing  to  You.
O  great  soul ,  why  should  they  not  bow  to  You ,  who  are  the  progenitor  of  Brahma  himself  and  the  greatest  of  the  great?  O  infinite  Lord  of  celestials ,  Abode  of  the  universe ,  You  are  that  which  is  existent ,  that  which  is  non-existentand  also  that  which  is  beyond  both ,  viz. ,  the  indestructible  Brahma.
You  are  the  primal  Deity ,  the  most  ancient  Person;  You  are  the  ultimate  resort  of  this  universe.  You  are  both  the  knower  and  the  knowable ,  and  the  highest  abode.  It  is  You  who  pervade  the  universe ,  assuming  endless  forms.
You  are  Vayu ,  Yama ,  Agni ,  the  moon-god ,  Brahma ,  nay ,  the  father  of  Brahma  Himself.  Hail ,  hail  to  You  a  thousand  times;  salutations ,  repeated  salutations  O  You  once  again.
O  Lord  of  infinite  prowess ,  my  salutations  to  You  from  before  and  from  behind.  O  soul  of  all ,  my  obeisance  to  You  from  all  sides  indeed.  You ,  who  possess  limitless  might ,  pervade  all;  therefore ,  You  are  all.
O  Krishna ,  O  Yadava ,  O  friend!  Thinking  of  You  as  a  mere  companion ,  whatever  I  have  said  rashly ,  without  understanding  Your  greatness ,  and  disrespectfully  in  jest ,  while  at  play ,  reposing ,  sitting  or  at  meals ,  either  alone  or  before  others ,  for  all  that  I  crave  forgiveness  from  You ,  who  are  immeasurable.
And  whatever  insult  I  may  have  offered  to  You  in  jest ,  while  at  play ,  resting ,  sitting ,  or  at  meals ,  either  alone  or  in  front  of  others ,  O  Infallible  One ,  I  implore  You ,  the  immeasurable ,  to  forgive  me.
You  are  the  father  of  all  moving  and  non-moving  beings ,  the  greatest  of  gurus ,  and  eminently  worthy  of  worship.  There  is  no  one  superior  to  You;  how  then  can  there  be  anyone  equal  to  You  in  the  three  worlds?
Therefore ,  Lord ,  prostrating  my  body  at  Your  feet  and  bowing  low  I  seek  to  propitiate  You ,  the  ruler  of  all  and  worthy  of  all  praise.  It  behoves  You  to  bear  with  me  even  as  father  bears  with  his  son ,  a  friend  with  his  friend  and  a  husband  with  his  beloved  spouse ,
Having  Seen  Your  wondrous  form ,  which  was  never  seen  before ,  I  feel  transported  with  joy;  at  the  same  time  my  mind  is  tormented  by  fear.  Pray  reveal  to  me  that  divine  form;  the  form  of  Visnu  with  four  arms;  O  Lord  of  celestials  Abode  of  the  universe ,  be  gracious.
I  wish  to  see  You  wearing  the  crown ,  holding  the  mace  and  discus  in  Your  hands.  Therefore ,  O  thousand-armed  one ,  O  universal  form ,  manifest  Yourself  in  that  four-armed  form.Seeing  such  a  dreadful  Form  of  Mine  as  this ,  be  not  perturbed  or  perplexed;  with  a  fearless  and  complacent  mind ,  behold  once  more  this  My  form  adorned  with  conch ,  discus ,  mace  and  lotus.
Shree  Bhagavan  said:  Arjuna!  pleased  with  you  I  have  shown  you ,  through  My  own  power  of  Yoga ,  this  supreme ,  effulgent ,  primal  and  infinite  Cosmic  Body ,  which  was  never  seen  before  by  any  else  than  you.
Arjuna ,  in  this  mortal  world  I  cannot  be  seen  in  this  Form  by  anyone  else  than  you ,  either  through  study  of  the  Vedas  or  of  rituals ,  or  a  gain  through  gifts ,  actions  or  austere  penances.
Seeing  such  a  dreadful  Form  of  Mine  as  this ,  be  not  perturbed  or  perplexed;  with  a  fearless  and  complacent  mind ,  behold  once  again  the  same  four-armed  Form  of  Mine.
Sanjaya  said:  Having  spoken  thus  to  Arjuna ,  Bhagavan  Vasudeva  again  showed  to  him  in  the  same  way  His  own  four-armed  form;  and  then ,  assuming  a  gentle  form ,  the  high-souled  Shree  Krishna  consoled  the  frightened  Arjuna.
Arjuna  said:  Seeing  this  human  form  of  Yours ,  O  gentle  Janardana ,  I  now  feel  composed  and  conscious ,  having  returned  to  my  natural  state.  Arjuna  said:  Krishna ,  seeing  this  gentle  human  form  of  Yours  I  have  regained  my  composure  and  am  myself  again.
Shree  Bhagavan  said:  This  form  of  Minewhich  you  have  just  seen  is  exceedingly  difficult  to  perceive.  Even  the  gods  are  always  eager  to  behold  this  form.
Neither  by  study  of  the  Vedas  nor  by  penance ,  nor  again  by  charity ,  nor  even  by  ritual  can  I  be  seen  in  this  formas  you  have  seen  Me.
Through  single-minded  devotion ,  however ,  I  can  be  seen  in  this  form;  nay ,  known  in  essence  and  even  entered  into ,  O  valiant  Arjuna.
Arjuna ,  he  who  performs  all  his  duties  for  My  sake ,  depends  on  Me ,  is  devoted  to  Me;  has  no  attachment ,  and  is  free  from  malice  towards  all  beings ,  reaches  Me.
Arjuna  said:  The  devotees  who ,  with  their  minds  constantly  fixed  on  You  as  shown  above ,  adore  You  as  possessed  of  form  and  attributes ,  and  those  who  adore  as  the  supreme  Reality
Shree  Bhagavan  said:  I  consider  them  to  be  the  best  Yogis ,  who  endowed  with  supreme  faith ,  and  ever  united  through  meditation  with  Me ,  worship  Me  with  the  mind  centred  on  Me.
Those ,  however ,  who  fully  controlling  all  their  senses  and  even-minded  towards  all ,  and  devoted  to  the  welfare  of  all  beings ,  constantly  adore  as  their  very  self  the  unthinkable;  omnipresent ,  indestructible  indefinable ,  eternal ,  immovable ,  unmanifest  and  changeless  Brahma ,  they  too  come  to  Me.
Having  restrained  all  the  senses ,  even-minded  everywhere ,  intent  on  the  welfare  of  all  beings  verily  they  also  come  unto  Me
Of  course ,  the  strain  is  greater  for  those  who  have  their  mind  attached  to  the  Unmanifest;  for  atonement  with  the  Unmanifest  is  attained  with  difficulty  by  those  who  are  centred  in  the  body.
On  the  other  hand ,  those  who  depending  exclusively  on  Me ,  and  surrendering  all  actions  to  Me ,  worship  Me ,  constantly  meditating  on  Me  with  single-minded  devotion.
These ,  Arjuna ,  I  speedily  deliver  from  the  ocean  of  birth  and  death ,  their  mind  being  fixed  on  Me.
Therefore ,  fix  your  mind  on  Me ,  and  establish  your  intellect  in  Me  alone;  thereafter  you  will  abide  solely  in  Me.  There  is  no  doubt  about  it.
If  you  cannot  steadily  fix  the  mind  on  Me ,  Arjuna ,  then  seek  to  attain  Me  through  the  Yoga  of  repeated  practice.
If  You  are  unequal  even  to  the  pursuit  of  such  practice ,  be  intent  to  work  for  Me;  you  shall  attain  perfectioneven  by  performing  actions  for  My  sake.
If ,  taking  recourse  to  the  Yoga  of  My  realization ,  you  are  unable  even  to  do  this ,  then ,  subduing  your  mind  and  intellect  etc. ,  relinquish  the  fruit  of  all  actions.
Knowledge  is  better  than  practice ,  meditation  on  God  is  superior  to  knowledge ,  and  renunciation  of  the  fruit  of  actions  is  even  superior  to  meditation;  for  peace  immediately  follows  from  renunciation.
He  who  is  free  from  malice  towards  all  beings ,  friendly  and  compassionate ,  rid  of  'I'  and  'mine' ,  balanced  in  pleasure  and  pain ,  forgiving—such  a  devotee  is  dear  to  Me
Contented ,  ever  steadfast  in  yoga ,  self-controlled ,  firm  in  determination ,  with  mind  and  intellect  dedicated  to  Me ,  he  is  dear  to  Me.
He  who  is  not  a  source  of  annoyance  to  his  fellow-creatures ,  and  who  in  his  turn  does  not  feel  vexed  with  fellow-creatures ,  and  who  is  free  from  delight  and  envy  perturbation  and  fear ,  is  dear  to  Me.
He  who  is  free  from  desires ,  pure ,  expert ,  indifferent  to  pain  and  pleasure ,  and  who  has  renounced  all  undertakings ,  is  dear  to  Me.
He  who  neither  rejoices  nor  hates ,  nor  grieves ,  nor  desires  and  who  renounces  both  good  and  evil  actions  and  is  full  of  devotion ,  is  dear  to  Me.
He  who  is  alike  to  friend  and  foe ,  as  well  as  to  honour  and  ignominy ,  who  remains  balanced  in  heat  and  cold ,  pleasure  and  pain  and  other  contrary  experiences ,  and  is  free  from  attachment.
He  who  takes  praise  and  reproach  alike ,  and  is  given  to  contemplation  and  contented  with  any  means  of  subsistence  whatsoever ,  entertaining  no  sense  of  ownership  and  attachment  in  respect  of  his  dwelling  place  and  full  of  devotion  to  Me ,  that  man  is  dear  to  Me.
Those  devotees ,  however ,  who  partake  in  a  disinterested  way  of  this  nectar  of  pious  wisdom  set  forth  above ,  endowed  with  faith  and  solely  devoted  to  Me ,  they  are  extremely  dear  to  me.
Arjuna  said  I  wish  to  learn  about  Natureand  the  Spirit ,  the  field  and  the  knower  of  the  field ,  knowledge  and  that  which  ought  to  be  known ,  O  Keshava
Sri  Bhagavan  said:  This  body ,  Arjuna ,  is  termed  as  the  Field;  and  him  who  knows  it ,  the  sages  discerning  the  truth  about  both  refer  to  as  the  knower  of  the  Field.
Know  Myself  to  be  the  Ksetrajñaalso  in  all  the  Ksetras ,  Arjuna.  And  it  is  the  knowledge  of  Ksetra  and  Ksetrajñawhich  I  consider  as  Wisdom.
What  that  Ksetra  is  and  what  it  is  like;  and  also  what  are  its  evolutes ,  again ,  whence  is  what ,  and  also  finally  who  that  Ksetrajna  is  and  what  is  his  glory—hear  all  this  from  Me  in  a  nutshell.
The  truth  about  the  Ksetra  and  the  Ksetrajña  has  been  expounded  by  the  seers  in  manifold  ways;  again ,  it  has  been  separately  stated  in  different  Vedic  chants  and  also  in  the  conclusive  and  reasoned  texts  of  the  Brahmasutras.
The  five  elements ,  the  ego ,  the  intellect ,  the  Unmanifest ,  the  ten  organs ,  the  mind ,  and  the  five  objects  of  sense;—
Also  desire ,  aversion ,  pleasure ,  pain  the  physical  body ,  consciousness ,  firmness:  thus  is  the  Ksetra ,  with  its  evolutes ,  briefly  states.
Absence  of  pride ,  freedom  from  hypocrisy ,  non-violence ,  forbearance ,  straightness  of  body ,  speech  and  mind ,  devout  service  of  the  preceptor ,  internal  and  external  purity ,  steadfastness  of  mind  and  control  of  body ,  mind  and  the  senses.
Dispassion  towards  the  objects  of  the  senses ,  absence  of  ego ,  and  contemplation  of  the  miseries  born  of  birth ,  death ,  old  age ,  disease  and  faults.
Absence  of  attachment  and  the  feeling  of  mineness  in  respect  of  son ,  wife ,  home  etc. ,  and  constant  equipoise  of  mind  both  in  favourable  and  unfavourable  circumstances.
Devotion  to  Me ,  which  is  unwavering  by  other  engagements ,  residing  in  a  secluded  place ,  free  from  material  desires ,  and  without  love  for  the  society  of  materialistic  persons;
Fixity  in  self-knowledge  and  seeing  God  as  the  object  of  true  knowledge ,  all  this  is  declared  as  knowledge;  and  what  is  other  than  this  is  called  ignorance.
That  which  is  to  be  known ,  which  when  known  one  attains  immortality ,  is  the  beginningless  supreme  Brahman;  there  is  nothing  like  it  anywhere.  I  shall  speak  to  you  at  length  about  that  which  ought  to  be  known ,  and  knowing  which  one  attains  supreme  Bliss.  That  supreme  Brahma ,  who  is  the  lord  of  beginning  less  entities ,  is  said  to  be  neither  Satnor  Asat.
It  has  hands  and  feet  on  all  sides ,  eyes ,  head  and  mouth  in  all  directions ,  and  ears  all  round;  for  it  stands  pervading  all  in  the  universe.
Though  perceiving  all  sense-objects  it  is ,  really  speaking ,  devoid  of  all  senses.  Nay ,  though  unattached ,  it  is  the  sustainer  of  all  nonetheless;  and  though  attributeless ,  it  is  the  enjoyer  of  qualities.
It  exists  without  and  within  all  beings ,  and  constitutes  the  animate  and  inanimate  creation  as  well.  And  by  reason  of  Its  subtlety ,  It  is  incomprehensible;  it  is  close  at  hand  and  stand  afar  too.
Though  integral  like  space  in  its  undivided  aspect.  It  appears  divided  as  it  were  in  all  animate  and  inanimate  beings.  And  that  godhead ,  which  is  the  only  object  worth  knowing ,  is  the  sustainer  of  beings ,  the  destroyerand  the  creator  of  all.
That  is  the  light  of  all  lights ,  beyond  darkness;  it  is  knowledge ,  the  object  of  knowledge ,  and  the  goal  of  knowledge ,  the  most  subtle  of  all.
Thus  the  truth  of  the  Ksetra  and  knowledge ,  as  well  as  of  the  object  worth  knowing ,  God  has  been  briefly  discussed;  knowing  this  in  reality ,  My  devotee  enters  into  My  Being.
Prakrti  and  Purusha ,  know  both  these  as  beginningless ,  and  know  all  modifications  such  as  likes  and  dislikes  etc.  and  all  objects  constituted  of  the  three  Gunas  as  born  of  Prakrti.
Prakrti  is  said  to  be  responsible  for  bringing  forth  the  evolutes  and  the  instruments;  while  the  individual  soul  is  declared  to  be  the  cause  of  experience  of  joys  and  sorrows.
Only  the  Purusha  seated  in  Prakrti  senses  objects  of  the  nature  of  the  three  Gunas  evolved  from  Prakrti.  And  it  is  contact  with  these  Gunas  that  is  responsible  for  the  birth  of  this  soul  in  good  and  evil  wombs.
In  this  body ,  the  soul  is  indeed  the  Supreme  Soul.  Being  the  witness ,  it  is  the  seer;  being  the  giver  of  true  knowledge ,  it  is  the  approver;  being  the  sustainer  of  all ,  it  is  the  supporter;  being  the  enjoyer  of  life ,  it  is  the  enjoyer;  being  the  lord  of  Brahma  and  others ,  it  is  the  great  Lord;  and  being  pure  consciousness  and  bliss ,  it  is  called  the  Supreme  Soul.
He  who  thus  knows  the  Purushaand  Prakrtitogether  with  the  Gunas ,—even  though  performing  his  duties  in  every  way ,  is  never  born  again.
Some  by  meditation  behold  the  supreme  Spirit  in  the  heart  with  the  help  of  their  refined  and  sharp  intellect;  others  realize  It  through  the  discipline  of  Knowledge ,  and  others  again ,  through  the  discipline  of  Action.
Other  dull  witted  persons ,  however ,  not  knowing  thus ,  worship  even  as  they  have  heard  from  others;  and  even  those  who  are  thus  devoted  to  hearing ,  are  able  to  cross  the  ocean  of  mundane  existence  in  the  shape  of  death.  
Arjuna ,  whatsoever  being ,  animate  or  inanimate ,  is  born ,  know  it  as  emanated  from  the  union  of  Ksetraand  the  ksetrajña.
He  alone  truly  sees ,  who  sees  the  supreme  Lord  as  imperishable  and  abiding  equally  in  all  perishable  beings ,  both  animate  and  inanimate
For ,  he  who  kills  not  himself  by  himself  be  seeing  the  supreme  Lord ,  equally  present  in  all ,  as  one ,  thereby  reaches  the  supreme  state.
And  he  alone  really  sees ,  who  sees  all  actions  being  performed  in  every  way  by  Prakrti  alone ,  and  the  Self  as  the  non-doer.
The  moment  man  perceives  the  diversified  existence  of  beings  as  rooted  in  the  one  supreme  Spirit ,  and  the  spreading  forth  of  all  beings  from  the  same ,  that  very  moment  he  attains  Brahma.
O  Arjuna!  Being  without  beginning  and  devoid  of  qualities ,  this  imperishable  Supreme  Soul ,  though  residing  in  the  body ,  neither  acts  nor  is  affected.
As  the  all-pervading  ether  is  not  tainted  by  reason  of  its  subtlety ,  so  seated  everywhere  in  the  body ,  the  Self  is  not  affected  by  the  attributes  of  the  body  due  to  its  attributeless  character.
O  Arjuna!  Just  as  the  one  sun  illuminates  the  entire  world ,  in  the  same  way ,  the  one  Self  illuminates  the  entire  field.
Arjuna ,  as  the  one  sun  illumines  this  entire  universe ,  so  the  one  Atmaillumines  the  whole  Ksetra.
Shree  Bhagavan  said:  I  shall  discuss  once  more  the  supreme  wisdom ,  the  best  of  all  wisdoms ,  acquiring  which  all  sages  have  attained  highest  perfection ,  being  liberated  from  this  mundane  existence.
Those  who ,  by  practising  this  wisdom ,  have  entered  into  My  Being  are  not  born  again  at  the  cosmic  dawn  nor  feel  disturbed  even  during  the  cosmic  night.
My  primordial  Nature ,  known  as  the  great  Brahman ,  is  the  womb  from  which  all  beings  are  born ,  O  Bharata.  I  place  the  seed  of  consciousness  in  that  womb ,  and  from  the  union  of  the  inert  and  the  conscious ,  all  beings  come  into  existence.
Of  all  embodied  beings  that  appear  in  all  the  species  of  various  kinds  Arjuna ,  Prakrti ,  or  Nature  is  the  conceiving  Mother ,  while  I  am  the  seed-giving  Father.
Sattva ,  Rajas  and  Tamas—these  three  qualities  born  of  Prakriti  bind  the  imperishable  soul  to  the  body ,  O  mighty-armed  Arjuna.
Of  these  Sattva ,  being  immaculate ,  is  illuminating  and  flawless ,  Arjuna;  it  binds  through  identification  with  joy  and  wisdom.
Know  that  Rajas ,  which  is  passionate ,  born  of  desire  and  attachment ,  O  son  of  Kunti ,  binds  the  embodied  soul  by  attachment  to  actions  and  their  fruits.
And  know ,  Tamas ,  the  deluder  of  all  those  who  look  upon  the  body  as  their  own  self ,  as  born  of  ignorance.  It  binds  the  soul  through  error ,  sloth  and  sleep ,  Arjuna!
Sattva ,  O  Bharata ,  is  engaged  in  happiness;  Rajas  in  action;  and  Tamas ,  born  of  ignorance ,  deludes  all  beings  by  causing  error.
Overpowering  Rajas  And  Tamas ,  Sattva  prevails;  overpowering  Sattva  and  Tamas ,  Rajas  prevails  even  so ,  overpowering  Sattva  and  Rajas ,  Tamas ,  Rajas  prevails  even  so ,  overpowering  Sattva  and  Rajas ,  Tamas.
At  the  time  when  light  arises  in  all  the  organs  of  the  body ,  knowledge  arises ,  and  the  wise  one  becomes  firm  in  Sattva.
With  the  preponderance  of  Rajas ,  Arjuna ,  greed ,  activity ,  undertaking  of  actions  with  an  interested  motive ,  restlessness  and  a  thirst  for  enjoyment  make  their  appearance.
With  the  growth  of  Tamas ,  Arjuna ,  obtuseness  of  the  mind  and  senses ,  disinclination  to  perform  one’s  obligatory  duties ,  frivolity  and  stupor—all  these  appear.
When  a  man  dies  during  the  preponderance  of  Sattva ,  he  obtains  the  stainless  ethereal  worldattained  by  men  of  noble  deeds.
Dying  when  Rajas  predominates ,  he  is  born  among  those  attached  to  action;  even  so  the  man  who  has  expired  during  the  preponderance  of  Tamas  is  reborn  in  the  species  of  stupid  creatures ,  such  as  insects ,  and  beasts  etc.
The  reward  of  a  righteous  act ,  they  say ,  is  Sattvika  and  faultless;  sorrow  is  declared  to  be  the  fruit  of  a  Rajasika  act  and  ignorance ,  the  fruit  of  a  Tamasika  act.
Wisdom  follows  from  Sattva ,  and  greed ,  undoubtedly ,  from  Rajas ,  likewise  obstinate  error ,  stupor  and  also  ignorance  follow  from  Tamas.
Those  established  in  Sattva  ascend  upwards;  those  in  Rajas  remain  in  the  middle;  and  those  in  Tamas  go  downwards.
When  the  seer  perceives  no  agent  other  than  the  three  Gunas;  and  realizes  Me ,  the  supreme  Spirit  standing  entirely  beyond  these  Gunas ,  he  enters  into  My  Being.
Having  transcended  the  aforesaid  three  Gunas ,  which  have  caused  the  body ,  and  freed  from  birth ,  death ,  old  age  and  all  kinds  of  sorrow ,  this  soul  attains  supreme  bliss.
Arjuna  said:  What  are  the  marks  of  him  who  has  risen  above  the  three  Gunas ,  and  what  is  his  conduct?  And  how ,  Lord ,  does  he  rise  above  the  three  Gunas?
Shree  Bhagavan  said:  Arjuna ,  he  who  hates  not  lightand  activityand  even  stupor ,  when  prevalent ,  nor  longs  for  them  when  they  have  ceased.
He  who  is  indifferent  to  the  modes  of  nature ,  and  who  remains  unshaken ,  knowing  that  the  modes  act  on  the  modes ,  remains  established  in  the  Self  and  is  never  shaken.
He  who  is  ever  established  in  the  Self ,  takes  woe  and  joy  alike ,  regards  a  clod  of  earth ,  a  stone  and  a  piece  of  gold  as  equal  in  value ,  is  possessed  of  wisdom ,  perceives  the  pleasant  as  well  as  the  unpleasant  in  the  same  spirit ,  and  views  censure  and  praise  alike.
He  who  is  indifferent  to  honour  and  ignominy;  is  alike  to  the  cause  of  a  friend  as  well  as  to  that  of  an  enemy ,  and  has  renounced  the  senses  of  doership  in  all  undertakings ,  is  said  to  have  risen  above  the  three  Gunas.
He  too  who  constantly  worships  Me  through  the  Yoga  of  exclusive  devotion ,—transcending  these  three  Gunas ,  becomes  eligible  for  attaining  Brahma.
For ,  I  am  the  ground  of  the  imperishable  Brahma ,  of  immortality ,  of  the  eternal  virtue  and  of  unending  immutable  bliss.
Shree  Bhagavan  said:  He  who  knows  the  pipal  tree;  which  is  said  to  be  imperishable ,  having  its  root  above  and  branches  below ,  and  whose  leaves  are  the  Vedas—he  alone  knows  the  Vedas.
Fed  by  the  three  Gunas  and  having  sense-objects  for  their  tender  leaves ,  the  branches  of  the  aforesaid  treeextend  both  downwards  and  upwards;  and  its  roots ,  which  bind  the  soul  according  to  its  action  in  the  human  body ,  are  spread  in  all  regions ,  higher  as  well  as  lower.
The  nature  of  this  tree  of  creation  does  not  on  mature  thought  turn  out  what  it  is  represented  to  be;  for  it  has  neither  beginning  nor  end ,  nor  even  stability.  Therefore ,  felling  this  Pipal  tree ,  which  is  most  firmly  rooted ,  with  the  formidable  axe  of  dispassion.
Thereafter  a  man  should  diligently  seek  for  that  supreme  state ,  viz. ,  God ,  having  attained  to  which  they  return  no  more  to  this  world;  and  having  fully  resolved  that  he  stand  dedicated  to  that  primeval  BeingHimself ,  from  whom  the  flow  of  this  beginningless  creation  has  progressed ,  he  should  dwell  and  meditate  on  Him.
Those  who  have  conquered  pride ,  attachment ,  and  faults ,  who  are  always  spiritual ,  who  have  renounced  desires ,  who  are  free  from  dualities  of  pleasure  and  pain ,  who  are  free  from  delusion ,  and  who  are  established  in  the  imperishable  state.
Neither  the  sun  nor  the  moon  nor  even  fire  can  illumine  that  supreme  self-effulgent  state ,  attaining  to  which  they  never  return  to  this  world.  That  is  My  supreme  Abode.
The  eternal  Jivatma  in  this  body  is  a  particle  of  My  own  being;  and  it  is  that  alone  which  draws  round  itself  the  mind  and  the  five  senses ,  which  rest  in  Prakrti.
As  the  wind  carries  the  scent  from  its  source ,  so  the  living  entity ,  who  is  the  master  of  the  body ,  leaves  one  body  and  takes  hold  of  the  senses  with  the  mind  and  enters  another  body.
It  is  while  dwelling  in  the  senses  of  hearing ,  sight ,  touch ,  taste  and  smell ,  as  well  as  in  the  mind ,  Jivatma  enjoys  the  objects  of  senses.
The  ignorant  know  not  the  soul  departing  from  or  dwelling  in  the  body ,  or  enjoying  the  objects  of  senses  i.e. ,  even  when  it  is  connected  with  the  three  Gunas;  only  those  endowed  with  the  eye  of  wisdom  are  able  to  realize  it.
Striving  Yogis  too  are  able  to  realize  this  Self  enShreened  in  their  heart.  The  ignorant;  however ,  whose  heart  has  not  been  purified ,  know  not  this  Self  in  spite  of  their  best  endeavours.
The  light  in  the  sun ,  that  illumines  the  entire  solar  world ,  and  that  which  shines  in  the  moon  and  that  too  which  shines  in  the  fire ,  know  that  light  to  be  Mine.
And  permeating  the  soil ,  it  is  I  who  support  all  creatures  by  My  vital  power;  and  becoming  the  nectarine  moon ,  I  nourish  all  pllants.
Taking  the  form  of  fire  lodged  in  the  body  of  all  creatures  and  united  with  the  Pranaand  Apanabreaths ,  it  is  I  who  consume  the  four  kinds  of  food.
I  am  seated  in  the  hearts  of  all;  I  am  the  beginning ,  the  middle  and  the  end  of  knowledge.  I  am  memory ,  knowledge  and  forgetfulness.  I  am  indeed  the  knower  of  the  Vedas ,  and  the  author  of  Vedanta ,  and  the  remover  of  doubts.
The  perishable  and  the  imperishable  too—these  are  the  two  kinds  of  Purushas  in  this  world.  Of  these ,  the  bodies  of  all  beings  are  spoken  of  as  the  perishable;  while  the  jivatma  or  the  embodied  soul  is  called  imperishable.
The  Supreme  Person  is  yet  other  than  these ,  who ,  having  entered  all  the  three  worlds ,  upholds  and  maintains  all ,  and  has  been  spoken  of  as  the  imperishable  Lord  and  the  supreme  Spirit.
Since  I  am  wholly  beyond  the  perishable  world  of  matter  of  Ksetra ,  and  am  superior  even  to  the  imperishable  soul ,  hence  I  am  well  known  in  the  world  and  in  the  Vedas  as  the  Supreme  Person.
Arjuna ,  the  wise  man  who  thus  realizes  Me  as  the  Supreme  Person ,—knowing  all ,  he  constantly  worship  Mewith  his  whole  being.
Arjuna ,  this  most  esoteric  teaching  has  thus  been  imparted  by  Me;  grasping  it  in  essence  man  becomes  wise  and  his  mission  in  life  is  accomplished.
Absolute  fearlessness ,  perfect  purity  of  mind;  constant  fixity  in  the  Yoga  of  meditation  for  the  sake  of  Self-Realization ,  and  even  so  charity  in  its  Sattvika  form ,  control  of  the  senses ,  worship  of  god  and  other  deities  as  well  as  of  one’s  elders  including  the  performance  of  Agnihotraand  other  sacred  duties ,  study  and  teaching  of  the  Vedas  and  other  sacred  books  as  well  as  the  chanting  of  God’s  names  and  praises ,  suffering  hardships  for  the  discharge  of  one’s  sacred  obligations  and  straightness  of  mind  as  well  as  of  the  body  and  senses.
Non-violence  in  thought ,  word  and  deed ,  truthfulness  and  geniality  of  speech ,  absence  of  anger  even  on  provocation ,  disclaiming  doership  in  respect  of  actions ,  quietude  or  composure  of  mind ,  abstaining  from  malicious  gossip ,  compassion  towards  all  creatures ,  absence  of  attachment  to  the  objects  of  senses  even  during  their  contact  with  the  senses ,  mildness ,  a  sense  of  shame  in  transgressing  against  the  scriptures  or  usage ,  and  abstaining  from  frivolous  pursuits.
Sublimity ,  forbearance ,  fortitude ,  external  purity ,  bearing  enmity  to  none  and  absence  of  self-esteem—these  are  the  marks  of  him ,  who  is  born  with  the  divine  gifts  Arjuna.
Hypocrisy ,  arrogance  and  pride ,  and  anger ,  sternness  and  ignorance  too ,—these  are  marks  of  him ,  who  is  born  with  demoniac  properties.
The  divine  gift  has  been  recognized  as  conducive  to  liberation ,  and  the  demoniac  gift  as  conducive  to  bondage;  Grieve  not  Arjuna ,  for  you  are  born  with  the  divine  endowment.
There  are  only  two  types  of  men  in  this  world ,  Arjuna ,—the  one  possessing  a  divine  nature  and  the  other  possessing  a  demoniac  disposition.  Of  these ,  the  type  possessing  a  divine  nature  has  been  dealt  with  at  length;  now  hear  in  detail  from  Me  about  the  type  possessing  demoniac  disposition.  Clinging  to  this  false  view  these  slow-witted  men  of  a  vile  disposition  and  terrible  deeds ,  these  enemies  of  mankind;  prove  equal  only  to  the  destruction  of  the  universe.
Men  possessing  a  demoniac  disposition  know  not  what  is  right  activity  and  what  is  right  abstinence  from  activity.  Hence  they  possess  neither  puritynor  good  conduct  nor  even  truthfulness.
Men  possessing  a  demoniac  disposition  say  that  the  world  is  without  foundation ,  without  God ,  born  of  mutual  union  of  male  and  female  only;  therefore ,  desire  alone  is  its  cause.  What  else  can  there  be?
Clinging  to  this  false  view  these  slow-witted  men  of  a  vile  disposition  and  terrible  deeds ,  these  enemies  of  mankind;  prove  equal  only  to  the  destruction  of  the  universe.
Clinging  to  desires ,  wicked ,  arrogant ,  and  haughty ,  deluded  by  ignorance ,  they  take  refuge  in  false  doctrines  and  engage  in  impure  conduct  in  the  world.
Giving  themselves  up  to  innumerable  cares  ending  only  with  death ,  they  remain  devoted  to  the  enjoyment  of  sensuous  pleasures  and  are  positive  in  their  belief  that  this  is  the  highest  limit  of  joy.
Bound  by  hundreds  of  snares  of  desire ,  devoted  to  lust  and  anger ,  they  unjustly  accumulate  wealth  and  other  objects  for  the  sake  of  sensuous  enjoyment.
They  say  to  themselves ,  This  much  has  been  secured  by  me  today  and  now  I  shall  realize  this  ambition.  So  much  wealth  is  already  with  me  and  yet  again  this  shall  be  mine.
That  enemy  has  been  slain  by  me  and  I  shall  kill  those  others  too.  I  am  the  Lord  of  all ,  the  enjoyer  of  all  power;  I  am  endowed  with  all  supernatural  powers ,  and  am  mighty  and  happy.
I  am  wealthy  and  own  a  large  family;  who  else  is  like  unto  me?  I  will  sacrifice  to  gods ,  I  will  give  alms ,  I  will  make  merry.
Thus  blinded  by  ignorance ,  enveloped  in  the  mesh  of  delusion  and  addicted  to  the  enjoyment  of  sensuous  pleasures ,  their  mind  bewildered  by  numerous  thoughts ,  these  men  of  a  devilish  disposition  fall  into  the  foulest  hell.
Intoxicated  by  wealth  and  honour ,  those  self-conceited  and  haughty  men  worship  God  through  nominal  sacrifices  for  ostentation  without  following  the  sacred  rituals.
Given  over  to  egotism ,  brute  force ,  arrogance ,  lust  and  anger  etc.  and  culminating  others ,  they  hate  Medwelling  in  their  own  bodies  as  well  as  in  those  of  others.
These  haters ,  sinful ,  cruel  and  vilest  among  men ,  I  cast  again  and  again  into  demoniacal  wombs  in  this  world.
Failing  to  reach  Me ,  Arjun ,  these  stupid  souls  are  born  life  after  life  in  demoniac  wombs  and  then  verily  sink  down  to  a  still  lower  plane.
Desire ,  anger  and  greed—  this  triple  gate  of  hell  brings  about  the  ruination  of  the  soul.  Therefore ,  one  should ,  avoid  all  these  three.
Freed  from  these  three  gates  of  hell ,  man  works  his  own  salvation  and  thereby  attains  the  supreme  goal  i.e. ,  God.
Having  cast  aside  the  injunctions  of  the  scriptures ,  he  who  acts  in  an  arbitrary  way  according  to  his  own  sweet  will  neither  attains  perfection  nor  the  supreme  goal  nor  even  happiness.
Therefore ,  the  scripture  alone  is  your  guide  in  determining  what  should  be  done  and  what  should  not  be  done.  Knowing  this ,  you  ought  to  perform  only  such  action  as  is  ordained  by  the  scriptures.
Arjuna  said:  Those  who  endowed  with  faith ,  worship  gods  and  others  casting  aside  the  injunctions  of  the  scriptures ,  where  do  they  stand ,  Krishna ,—  in  Sattva ,  Rajas  or  Tamas?
Shree  Bhagavan  said:  that  untutored  innate  faith  of  men  is  of  three  kinds—Sattvika  and  Rajasika  and  Tamasika.  Hear  of  it  from  Me.
The  faith  of  all  men  conforms  to  their  mental  constitution ,  Arjuna.  This  man  consists  of  faith;  whatever  the  nature  of  his  faith ,  he  is  verily  that.
Men  of  a  Sattvika  disposition  worship  gods;  those  of  Rajasika  temperament  worship  demigods  and  demons;  while  others ,  who  are  men  of  a  Tamasika  disposition ,  worship  the  spirits  of  the  dead  and  groups  of  ghosts.
Those  who  perform  severe  austerities  not  ordained  by  scriptural  injunctions ,  motivated  by  pride  and  arrogance ,  and  attached  to  desire ,  passion ,  and  the  sense  of  strength ,  are  known  as  the  austerity  people.
And  who  emaciate  the  elements  constituting  their  body  as  well  as  Me ,  the  supreme  Spirit ,  dwelling  in  their  heart ,—know  these  senseless  people  to  have  a  demoniac  disposition.
Food  also ,  which  is  agreeable  to  different  men  according  to  their  innate  disposition ,  is  of  three  kinds.  And  likewise  sacrifice ,  penance  and  charity  too  are  of  three  kinds  each;  hear  their  distinction  as  follows.
Foods  which  promote  longevity ,  intelligence ,  vigour ,  health ,  happiness  and  cheerfulness ,  and  which  are  sweet ,  bland ,  substantial  and  naturally  agreeable ,  are  dear  to  the  Sattvika  type  of  men.
Foods  which  are  bitter ,  acid ,  salty ,  overhot ,  pungent ,  dry  and  burning ,  and  which  cause  suffering ,  grief  and  sickness ,  are  dear  to  the  Rajasika  type  of  men.
Food  which  is  half-cooked  or  half-ripe ,  insipid ,  putrid ,  stale  and  polluted ,  and  which  is  impure  too ,  is  dear  to  men  a  Tamasika  disposition.
The  sacrifice  which  is  offered ,  as  ordained  by  scriptural  injunctions ,  by  men  who  expect  no  return  and  who  believe  that  such  sacrifices  must  be  performed ,  is  Sattvika  in  character.
That  sacrifice;  however ,  which  is  offered  for  the  sake  of  mere  show  or  even  with  an  eye  to  its  fruit ,  know  it  to  be  Rajasika  Arjuna.
A  sacrifice  which  has  no  respect  for  scriptural  injunctions ,  in  which  no  food  is  offered ,  and  no  sacrificial  fees  are  paid ,  which  is  without  sacred  chant  and  devoid  of  faith ,  is  said  to  be  Tamasika.
Worship  of  gods ,  the  Brahmanas ,  one’s  elders  and  wise  men ,  purity ,  straightness ,  continence  and  harmlessness—this  is  called  bodily  penance.
Words  which  cause  no  annoyance  to  others  and  are  truthful ,  agreeable  and  wholesome ,  as  well  as  the  study  of  the  Vedas  and  other  Sastras  and  the  practice  of  repetition  of  the  Divine  Name—this  is  known  as  the  austerity  of  speech.
Cheerfulness  of  mind ,  placidity ,  habit  of  silence ,  self-restraint ,  purity  of  feelings—thus  is  the  austerity  of  mind  known.
This  threefold  penance  performed  with  supreme  faith  by  Yogis  expecting  no  return  is  called  Sattvika.
The  penance  which  is  performed  for  the  sake  of  show ,  honor ,  and  worship ,  or  for  any  other  selfish  purpose ,  either  by  nature  or  hypocrisy ,  is  said  to  be  Rajasic ,  producing  uncertain  and  temporary  results.
Austerity  which  is  practised  through  perversity  and  is  accompanied  with  self-mortification  or  is  intended  to  harm  others ,  such  austerity  has  been  declared  as  Tamasika.
A  gift  which  is  bestowed  with  a  sense  of  duty  on  one  who  is  no  benefactor  when  a  fit  place ,  suitable  time  and  a  deserving  person  are  available ,  that  gift  has  been  pronounced  as  Sattvika.
A  gift  which  is  bestowed  in  a  grudging  spirit  and  with  the  object  of  getting  a  service  in  return  or  in  the  hope  of  obtaining  a  reward ,  is  called  Rajasika.
A  gift  which  is  made  without  good  grace  and  in  a  disdainful  spirit  out  of  time  and  place  and  to  undeserving  persons ,  is  said  to  be  Tamasika.
OM ,  TAT  and  SAT—This  has  been  declared  as  the  threefold  appellation  of  the  Absolute ,  who  is  Truth ,  Consciousness  and  Bliss  solidified.  By  That  the  Brahmanas  and  the  Vedas  as  well  as  sacrifices  were  created  at  the  cosmic  dawn.
Therefore ,  acts  of  sacrifice ,  charity  and  austerity  as  enjoined  by  sacred  precepts  are  always  commenced  by  noble  souls  given  to  the  recitation  of  Vedic  chants  with  utterance  of  the  divine  name  OM.
With  the  idea  that  all  this  belongs  to  that  Supreme  Being ,  various  acts  of  sacrifice ,  austerity  and  charity  are  performed  by  men  desiring  welfare ,  without  attachment  to  the  fruits.
The  name  of  God ,  SAT ,  is  employed  in  the  sense  of  truth  and  goodness.  And  the  word  SAT  is  also  used  in  the  sense  of  a  praiseworthy  act ,  Arjuna.
And  the  steadfastness  in  sacrifice ,  austerity ,  and  charity  is  also  called  'Sat ,'  and  action  done  for  the  sake  of  the  Supreme  is  also  designated  as  'Sat'.
O  Arjuna!  Sacrifice  performed  without  faith ,  charity  given  without  faith ,  austerity  performed  without  faith ,  and  any  action  done  without  faith  are  all  said  to  be  'Asat';  such  actions  are  neither  beneficial  in  this  world  nor  after  death.
Arjuna  said:  O  mighty-armed  Shree  Krishna ,  O  inner  controller  of  all ,  O  Slayer  of  Kesi ,  I  wish  to  know  severally  the  truth  of  Samnyasa  and  Tyaga.
Shree  Bhagavan  said:  Some  sages  understand  Samnyasa  as  the  giving  up  of  all  actions  motivated  by  desire;  and  other  thinkers  declare  that  Tyaga  consists  in  relinquishing  the  fruit  of  all  actions.
Some  wise  men  declare  that  all  actions  contain  a  measure  of  evil ,  and  are  therefore  worth  giving  up ,  while  others  say  that  acts  of  sacrifice ,  charity  and  penance  are  not  to  be  given  up.
Of  Samnyasa  and  Tyaga ,  first  hear  My  conclusion  on  the  subject  of  Tyaga ,  Arjuna;  for  Tyaga ,  O  tiger  among  men ,  has  been  declared  to  be  of  three  kinds—Sattvika ,  Rajasika  and  Tamasika.
Acts  of  sacrifice ,  charity  and  penance  are  not  worth  giving  up;  they  must  be  performed.  For  sacrifice ,  charity  and  penance—all  these  are  purifiers  of  wise  men.
Hence  these  acts  of  sacrifice ,  charity  and  penance ,  and  all  other  acts  too ,  must  be  performed  without  attachment  and  hope  of  reward:  this  is  My  considered  and  supreme  verdict ,  Arjuna.  A  prescribed  duty  which  is  performed  simply  because  it  has  to  be  performed ,  giving  up  attachment  and  fruit ,  that  alone  has  been  recognized  as  the  Sattvika  form  of  renunciation.
But  it  is  not  advisable  to  abandon  a  prescribed  duty.  Its  abandonment  through  ignorance  has  been  declared  as  Tamasika.
Should  anyone  give  up  his  duties  for  fear  of  physical  strain ,  thinking  that  all  action  is  verily  of  the  nature  of  discomfort ,—practising  such  Rajasika  form  of  renunciation ,  he  reaps  not  the  fruit  renunciation.
A  prescribed  duty  which  is  performed  simply  because  it  has  to  be  performed ,  giving  up  attachment  and  fruit ,  that  alone  has  been  recognized  as  the  Sattvika  form  of  renunciation.
One  who  does  not  look  with  desire  upon  the  unskilled  work  and  is  not  attached  to  the  skilled  work ,  that  man  is  a  true  renunciant ,  endowed  with  pure  goodness ,  free  from  doubt ,  and  wise.
Since  all  actions  cannot  be  given  up  in  their  entirety  by  anyone  possessing  a  body ,  he  alone  who  renounces  the  fruit  of  actions  is  called  a  man  of  renunciation.
Welcome ,  unwelcome  and  mixed-threefold ,  indeed ,  is  the  fruit  that  accrues  hereafter  from  the  actions  of  the  unrenouncing.  But  there  is  none  ever  for  those  who  have  renounced.
O  mighty-armed ,  understand  these  five  causes  by  me  explained ,  which  are  declared  in  the  Sankhya  doctrine  as  the  means  for  the  accomplishment  of  all  actions.
The  following  are  the  factors  operating  towards  the  accomplishment  of  actions ,  viz. ,  the  seat  of  action  and  the  agent ,  the  organs  of  different  kinds  and  the  separate  movements  of  divergent  types;  and  the  fifth  is  Daiva  or  destiny.
These  five  are  the  contributory  causes  of  whatever  actions ,  right  or  wrong  man  performs  with  the  mind ,  speech  and  body.
Notwithstanding  this ,  however ,  he  who ,  having  an  impure  mind ,  regards  the  absolute ,  taintless  Self  alone  as  the  doer ,  that  man  of  perverse  understanding  does  not  view  aright.
He  whose  mind  is  free  from  the  sense  of  doership ,  and  whose  reason  is  not  tainted  by  worldly  objects  and  activities ,  does  not  really  slay ,  even  having  slaughtered  all  these  creatures ,  nor  is  bound  by  sin.
The  knower ,  knowledge  and  the  object  of  knowledge—these  three  are  the  causes  of  action;  the  agent ,  the  instrument  and  the  action—these  three  constitute  the  collection  of  actions.
In  the  branch  of  knowledge  dealing  with  the  Gunas  or  modes  of  Prakrti ,  knowledge  and  action  as  well  as  the  doer  have  been  declared  to  be  of  three  kinds  according  to  the  Guna  which  predominates  in  each;  hear  them  too  duly  from  Me.
That  by  which  man  perceives  one  imperishable  divine  existence  as  undivided  and  equally  present  in  all  individual  beings ,  know  that  knowledge  to  be  Sattvika.
That ,  however ,  by  which  man  cognize  many  existences  of  various  kinds  as  apart  from  one  another  in  all  beings ,  know  that  knowledge  to  be  Rajasika.
Again ,  that  knowledge  which  clings  to  one  body  as  if  it  were  the  whole ,  and  which  is  irrational ,  has  no  real  object  and  is  trivial ,  has  been  declared  as  Tamasika.
That  action  which  is  ordained  by  the  scriptures  and  is  not  accompanied  by  the  sense  of  doership ,  and  has  been  done  without  any  partiality  or  prejudice  by  one  who  seeks  no  return ,  is  called  Sattvika.
That  action ,  however ,  which  involves  much  strain  and  is  performed  by  one  who  seeks  enjoyments  or  by  a  man  full  of  egotism ,  has  been  spoken  of  as  Rajasika.
That  action  which  is  undertaken  through  sheer  ignorance ,  without  counting  the  upshot ,  loss  to  oneself ,  injury  to  others  and  one’s  own  capacity ,  is  declared  as  Tamasika.
Free  from  attachment ,  unegoistic ,  endowed  with  firmness  and  vigour  and  unswayed  by  success  and  failure—such  a  doer  is  said  to  be  Sattvika.
The  doer  who  is  full  of  attachment ,  seeks  the  fruit  of  actions  and  is  greedy ,  and  who  is  oppressive  by  nature  and  of  impure  conduct ,  and  is  affected  by  joy  and  sorrow  has  been  called  Rajasika.
Lacking  piety  and  self-control ,  uncultured ,  arrogant ,  deceitful ,  inclined  to  rob  others  of  their  livelihood ,  slothful ,  down-hearted  and  procrastinating ,  such  a  doer  is  called  Tamasika.
Hear ,  O  Dhananjaya ,  now  I  shall  fully  and  distinctly  explain  to  you  the  threefold  division  of  the  qualities  of  intellect  and  fortitude.
The  intellect  which  correctly  determines  the  paths  of  activity  and  renunciation ,  what  ought  to  be  done  and  what  should  not  be  done ,  what  is  fear  and  what  is  fearlessness ,  and  what  is  bondage  and  what  is  liberation ,  that  intellect  is  Sattvika.
By  which  a  person  knows  what  is  duty  and  what  is  not  duty ,  what  is  action  and  what  is  inaction ,  that  intellect ,  O  Partha ,  is  Rajasic.  The  intellect  by  which  man  does  not  truly  perceive  what  is  Dharma  and  what  is  Adharma ,  what  ought  to  be  done  and  what  should  not  be  done ,—that  intellect  is  Rajasika.
The  intellect  which  imagines  even  Adharma  to  be  Dharma ,  and  sees  all  other  things  upside-down ,—wrapped  in  ignorance ,  that  intellect  is  Tamasika ,  Arjuna.
The  unwavering  firmness  by  which  man  controls  through  the  Yoga  of  meditation  the  functions  of  the  mind ,  the  vital  airs  and  the  senses—that  firmness ,  Arjuna ,  is  Sattvika.
The  Dhrti ,  however ,  by  which  the  man  seeking  a  reward  for  his  actions ,  clutches  with  extreme  fondness  virtues ,  earthly  possessions  and  worldly  enjoyments ,—that  Dhrti  is  Rajasika ,  Arjuna.
The  firmness  by  which  a  foolish  person  does  not  give  up  sleep ,  fear ,  grief ,  despondency ,  and  pride  —  that  firmness ,  O  Partha ,  is  Tāmasika
Now  hear  from  Me  the  threefold  joy  too.  That  is  which  the  striver  finds  enjoyments  through  practice  of  adoration ,  meditation  and  service  to  God  etc. ,  and  whereby  he  reaches  the  end  of  sorrow.
Such  a  joy ,  though  appearing  as  poison  in  the  beginning ,  tastes  like  nectar  in  the  end;  hence  that  joy ,  born  as  it  is  of  the  placidity  of  mind  brought  about  by  meditation  on  God ,  has  been  declared  as  Sattvika.
The  delight  which  follows  from  the  contact  of  the  senses  with  their  objects  is  eventually  poison-like ,  though  appearing  at  first  as  nectar;  hence  it  has  been  spoken  of  as  Rajasika.
That  which  stupefies  the  self  during  its  enjoyment  as  well  as  in  the  end ,  derived  from  sleep ,  indolence  and  obstinate  error;  such  delight  has  been  called  Tamasika.
There  is  no  being  in  the  earth ,  in  the  heavens  or  among  the  gods ,  nor  anywhere  else ,  that  is  free  from  these  three  qualities  born  of  Prakriti.
The  duties  of  the  Brahmanas ,  the  Ksatriyas  and  the  Vaisyas ,  as  well  as  of  the  Sudras ,  have  been  divided  according  to  their  inborn  qualities ,  Arjuna.
Subjugation  of  the  mind  and  senses ,  enduring  hardships  for  the  discharge  of  one’s  sacred  obligations ,  external  and  internal  purity ,  forgiving  the  faults  of  others ,  straightness  of  mind ,  senses  and  behaviour ,  belief  in  the  Vedas  and  other  scriptures ,  God  and  life  after  death  etc. ,  study  and  teaching  of  the  Vedas  and  other  scriptures  and  realization  of  the  truth  relating  to  God—all  these  constitute  the  natural  duty  of  a  Brahmana.
Exhibition  of  valour ,  fearlessness ,  firmness ,  cleverness  and  steadiness  in  battle ,  bestowing  gifts ,  and  lordliness—all  these  constitute  the  natural  duty  of  a  Ksatriya.
Agriculture ,  rearing  of  cows  and  honest  exchange  of  merchandise—these  constitute  the  natural  duty  of  a  Vaisya.  And  service  of  the  other  classes  in  the  natural  duty  of  a  Sudra.
Keenly  devoted  to  his  own  natural  duty ,  man  attains  the  highest  perfection  in  the  shape  of  God-Realization.  Hear  the  mode  of  performance  whereby  the  man  engaged  in  his  inborn  duty  reaches  that  highest  consummation.
Man  attains  the  highest  perfection  by  worshipping  Him  through  his  own  natural  duties  from  whom  the  tide  of  creation  has  streamed  forth  and  by  whom  all  this  universe  is  pervaded.
Better  is  one’s  own  duty ,  though  devoid  of  merit ,  than  the  duty  of  another  well-performed;  for  performing  the  duty  ordained  by  his  own  nature  man  does  not  incur  sin.
Therefore ,  Arjuna ,  one  should  not  abandon  one’s  innate  duty ,  even  though  it  may  be  tainted  with  blemish;  for  even  as  fire  is  enveloped  in  smoke ,  all  undertakings  are  clouded  with  demerit.
He  whose  intellect  is  unattached  everywhere ,  whose  thirst  for  enjoyments  has  altogether  disappeared  and  who  has  subdued  his  mind ,  reaches  through  Sankhyayogathe  consummation  of  actionlessness.
Arjuna ,  know  from  Me  only  briefly  the  process  through  which  man  having  attained  actionlessness ,  which  is  the  highest  consummation  of  Jñanayogareaches  Brahma.
Endowed  with  an  untarnished  intellect  and  partaking  of  a  light ,  Sattvika  and  regulated  diet ,  having  rejected  sound  and  other  objects  of  sense ,  and  having  completely  got  rid  of  attraction  and  aversion.
Living  in  a  lonely  and  undefiled  place ,  partaking  of  light  food ,  controlling  speech ,  body  and  mind ,  remaining  ever  devoted  to  meditation ,  taking  constant  recourse  to  dispassion.
Having  given  up  egotism ,  strength ,  arrogance ,  desire ,  anger  and  possessions ,  devoid  of  ‘mineness ,’  tranquil  in  heart ,  the  man  becomes  qualified  for  oneness  with  Brahma.
Endowed  with  an  untarnished  intellect  and  partaking  of  a  light ,  Sattvika  and  regulated  diet ,  living  in  a  lonely  and  undefiled  place  having  rejected  sound  and  other  objects  of  sense ,  having  controlled  the  mind ,  speech  and  body  by  restraining  the  mind  and  senses  through  firmness  of  a  Sattvika  type ,  taking  a  resolute  stand  on  dispassion ,  after  having  completely  got  rid  of  attraction  and  aversion  and  remaining  ever  devoted  to  the  Yoga  of  meditation  having  given  up  egotism ,  violence ,  arrogance ,  lust ,  anger  and  luxuries ,  devoid  of  the  feeling  of  meum  and  tranquil  of  hear ,—such  a  man  becomes  qualified  for  oneness  with  Brahma ,  who  is  Truth  Consciousness  and  Bliss.
Through  that  supreme  devotion  he  comes  to  know  Me  in  reality ,  what  and  how  great  I  am;  and  thereby  knowing  Me  in  essence  he  forthwith  enters  into  My  being.
The  Karmayogi ,  however ,  who  depends  on  Me ,  attains  by  My  grace  the  eternal ,  imperishable  state ,  even  though  performing  all  actions.
Mentally  resigning  all  your  duties  to  Me ,  and  taking  recourse  to  Yoga  in  the  form  of  even-mindedness ,  be  solely  devoted  to  Me  and  constantly  give  your  mind  to  Me.
With  your  mind  thus  given  to  Me ,  you  shall  tide  over  all  difficulties  by  My  grace.  And  if ,  from  egotism ,  you  will  not  listen ,  you  will  be  lost.
If  you  think ,  'I  will  not  fight ,'  taking  shelter  in  egoism ,  your  determination  is  false ,  for  your  nature  will  compel  you  to  engage  in  battle.
That  action  too  which  you  are  not  willing  to  undertake  through  ignorance ,—bound  by  your  own  duty  born  of  your  nature ,  you  will  helplessly  perform.
The  Supreme  Lord  is  situated  in  the  hearts  of  all  beings ,  O  Arjuna ,  and  is  directing  the  wanderings  of  all  living  entities ,  who  are  seated  as  on  a  machine ,  made  of  the  material  energy.
Take  shelter  in  Him  alone ,  with  all  your  being ,  Arjuna.  By  His  mere  grace  you  shall  attain  supreme  peace  and  the  eternal  state.
Thus  I  have  explained  to  you  knowledge ,  more  secret  than  all  secrets.  Reflect  on  this  fully  and  then  do  as  you  wish.
Hear ,  again ,  My  supremely  secret  word ,  the  most  esoteric  of  all  truths.  You  are  extremely  dear  to  Me;  therefore ,  I  shall  offer  you  this  salutary  advice.
Be  devoted  to  Me ,  worship  Me ,  bow  down  to  Me.  You  shall  come  to  Me  alone;  this  is  My  promise  to  you.  You  are  dear  to  Me.  Give  your  mind  to  Me ,  be  devoted  to  Me ,  worship  Me  and  bow  to  Me.  Doing  so  you  will  come  to  Me  alone ,  I  truly  promise  you;  for  you  are  exceptionally  dear  to  Me.
Resigning  all  your  duties  to  Me ,  the  all-powerful  and  all-supporting  Lord ,  take  refuge  in  Me  alone.  I  shall  absolve  you  of  all  sins ,  worry  not.
This  secret  gospel  of  the  Gita  should  never  be  imparted  to  a  man  who  lacks  penance ,  nor  to  him  who  is  wanting  in  devotion ,  nor  even  to  him  who  lends  not  a  willing  ear;  and  in  no  case  to  him  who  finds  fault  with  Me.
He  who ,  offering  the  highest  love  to  Me ,  preaches  the  most  profound  gospel  of  the  gita  among  my  devotees ,  shall  come  to  me  alone ,  there  is  no  doubt  about  it.
Among  men  there  is  none  who  does  me  a  more  loving  service  than  he ,  nor  shall  anyone  be  dearer  to  me  on  the  entire  globe  than  he.
Whosoever  studies  this  sacred  dialogue  of  ours  in  the  form  of  the  Gita ,  by  him  too  shall  I  be  worshipped  through  the  sacrifice  of  knowledge—such  is  my  opinion.
The  man  who  hears  the  holy  Gita  with  reverence  and  in  an  uncarping  spirit ,—liberated  from  sin ,  he  too  shall  reach  the  happy  worlds  of  the  virtuous.
O  Partha ,  have  you  listened  to  this  with  concentrated  mind?  And  O  Dhananjaya ,  has  your  delusion  born  of  ignorance  been  dispelled?
Arjuna  said:  Krishna ,  by  Your  grace  my  delusion  has  fled  and  wisdom  has  been  gained  by  me.  I  stand  shorn  of  all  doubts.  I  will  do  your  bidding.
Sanjaya  said:  Thus  I  heard  the  mysterious  and  thrilling  conversation  between  Shree  Krishna  and  the  high-souled  Arjuna ,  son  of  Kunti.
Having  been  blessed  with  the  divine  vision  by  the  grace  of  Shree  Vyasa ,  I  heard  this  supremely  esoteric  gospel  from  the  Lord  of  Yoga ,  Shree  Krishna  Himself ,  imparting  it  to  Arjuna  before  my  very  eyes.
Remembering ,  over  and  over ,  that  sacred  and  mystic  conversation  between  Bhagavan  Shree  Krishna  and  Arjuna ,  O  King!  I  rejoice  again  and  yet  again.
Remembering  also ,  again  and  again ,  that  most  wonderful  Form  of  Shree  Krishna ,  great  is  my  wonder  and  I  rejoice  over  and  over  again.
Wherever  there  is  Bhagavan  Shree  Krishna ,  the  Lord  of  Yoga ,  and  wherever  there  is  Arjuna ,  the  wielder  of  the  Gandiva  bow ,  goodness ,  victory ,  glory  and  unfailing  righteousness  are  there:  such  is  my  conviction.
