among millions of such performers of fruitive activities according to Vedic principles

various activities favorable for devotional service

all those items
their respective houses
the respective places

under His control
that which
not like that
on which he should not have lamented
though not qualified for it
not deserving such from them
unsuitable for a person like you
although not fit for carrying the palanquin
who did not deserve
by accepting the body as the self
from the bodily concept of life
without knowledge
by persons not knowing his real position
most ignorant
bereft of spiritual knowledge
without understanding his exalted position
by expanding activities in the material field
not knowing the secret (of the portents)
without knowledge of the supremely powerful Personality of Godhead (because of intense love for Krsna)
when Citraketu
not experienced at that
persons who are not conversant with this
that ultimate cause
in the presence of the assembly members
they resemble the teeth of the animal
being intent
that offense
considering this matter
there were born
that sinful reaction
in the heart
thereafter
at that time also
in that case also
not finding pleasure in it due to its being difficult for unscrupulous persons to perform
without thinking of all these things
therefore the Personality of Godhead
becomes beneficial
being separated
therefore please explain that
that also

hearing that news
that abode
the universes and the universal form
that binding rope
sees everything
that same
now both of you may return
the cause of all causes
all about
all these material manifestations
loudly declared the incident
that knowledge
that action (striking the head of Indra's elephant with the club in his left hand)
at the end of the millennium
that abode
in Krsna consciousness
who knew very well the influence of the Ganges River
mind into breathing
that transcendental form
all that you have inquired from me
his powerful semen
"the Vedic mantra tat tvam asi (""you are the same"")"
establishment of the statement tat tvam asi
that indirectly
that which was instructed by his father
those words
but that is
by seeing that
that influence
you must know it
knowing this fully
please explain that knowledge
that poison
that are pained
the residence
knowing spiritual knowledge
consecrated by the mantra of Bhadra Kali
by contact with His limbs
regarding himself as the killed or the killer
His desire
in the absence of such advanced transcendentalists
to persons who have taken fully to Krsna consciousness
in occupying that post
(produced from) his (Daksa's) sacrifice
his body
of His lotus feet
his big toe
on His lap
at the spotless lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead
all of them brought
satisfied by the foodstuff of the sacrifice
now became entangled with the affairs of Krsna
in that Manu's period
existing between the east
at the end
near him
near to him
the ultimate goal of such activities
because of performing such great sacrifices
his followers or assistants
engaged in governing the globe
according to his order
His causeless mercy
by his mercy
to show His mercy
the companions of Sudyumna
with their permission
being permitted by Him (Lord Vamana)
accordingly
words suitable to reply to theirs
to follow the instruction of the sastras
as they remembered their sons
his (Daksa's) followers
in the dynasty of him (Mahabhoja)
thus accompanied by them
of his daughter
everyone depends upon You
offering the result of activities
in the prasada offered to the Lord
for the sake of the body
for the sake of nectar
her husband's bones
simply by seeing her
to the residential quarters of Nanda Maharaja
in his wife
in the same posture
the cursing of Siva
unto the friends and relatives of the husband
as well as relatives of forefathers
in the performance of such a yajna
in that way all who were disappointed
unto His devotees
who renders devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead
the devotees of the Lord
unto His devotee
with the husbands
different features of that
of the servants of Krsna
of the situation of the Supreme Lord's activities
that highest stage of joy
with thoughts of Krsna
in which the activities of her own child were enacted
of the Lord's energy
at His lotus feet
fallen from his lotus feet
one always engaged in service at the lotus feet of Lord Ramacandra
his lotus feet
the activities of the Lord
their characteristics
all the remnants (the water and flowers offered to the Deity)
on his head
the education in that
with full anxiety because of Prahlada Maharaja's position
by thoughts of Him
great grand-disciples
who is on the level of their disciple
thinking or being conscious of Lord Ramacandra
being too much attached to her
beautifully standing
readiness to render service to her husband
onto the horn of the big fish
of burning corpses
for meeting Him (Lord Sri Krsna)
being very much enlivened by seeing the beautiful woman
desiring to see him again
after seeing the Lord
the body of Maharaja Nimi
her body
the property in the possession of a child
concerning that religious principle
by following in the footsteps of the Lord
of the devotees
religious (relating to the prosecution of the varnasrama-dharma)
His place of residence
that abode
the fault of that
the daughters of the mountains (the rivers)
the master of that island
within that island
the master of that island
giving the island its name
of that island
twice that
by His glaring glance
the loving service of the Lord
engrossed in such thoughts
just to look upon Him (Krsna)
all the thoughts of the cowherd men merged in the mellow of paternal love
seeing the relationship with Govinda
being protected by the Lord
the name is tad-ekatma
the same form
in the form of tad-ekatma
of that disease
the aroma of the lotus flower
his mind saturated with devotional service
being attracted by him
being attracted to her
the movements of the polluted intelligence
unto His abode
from great respect for the words of Prahlada Maharaja (due to his being a devotee)
of that mountain (Trikuta)
the descendant of Akriya
the qualities of the Lord
are not touched by the material qualities
according to shape and quality
by the qualities
qualities in connection with matter
those modes of nature
their priest or spiritual master
which is actually Your residence
in the home of him (the master)
from the hand of Kamsa
disrespect to them
the heart of Ravana
Their mothers (Rohini and Yasoda)
the birthday of the Lord
of knowledge of devotional service
knowing those things
by sense gratification in the association of such debauchees
exactly like a human child
his neck
in the hand of the Lord
because of being touched on the head by the lotus hand of Nrsimhadeva
on the ears
the whorl of that lotus flower
his activities
to do that
of the pastimes of Krsna and Balarama
by reciting the Bhagavatam
in those narrations
in discourses about the Lord
the stem of the lotus
of the agitation of the modes of material nature
the abdomen of Vrtrasura
by the leader of the palanquin carriers
looking for His mercy
reactionary to that
rendered by that
done by the water
for the sake of that
according to the particular time
born at that time
which was effected by eternal time
by the passion of lusty desires at that moment
at that proper time
described as happening now (in the pauganda age)
His pastimes
worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead
whether the child was male or female
achieved the same planet
His glorious abode
by being fully absorbed in Krsna
of that Manu
by Santanu's minister
being too afflicted
his mind
consisting of Him (Krsna)
being absorbed in that way
absorption in Him
thinking as if he had become Krsna
consisting of that transcendental attachment
her beautiful face
from their mouths
to uproot them completely
because of being the root of this tree
taking shelter at His lotus feet
who is garlanded with human skulls and smeared with ashes
their mother
Krsna's affectionate mothers (offering the beloved child their breasts)
Their mothers (Rohini and Yasoda)
of the mothers of the cowherd boys and calves
the sense objects (sound
sense perception
the subtle element
sense perception
in the objects of the senses
the subtle elements
in the presence of His mother
and about how Putana had died
the residence of Lord Visnu
caused by the sight of her
who are faithful devotees of the Lord
the cessation of that
whose mind is only meant for the Supreme
because of her loud vibration
the creation and manifestation of cosmic energy to stop the repetition of birth and death
being fully dedicated to Him (Lord Nrsimhadeva)
by the sound of those ankle bells
known by that name
having names according to their names
at the lotus feet of the Lord
at the feet of the King
from His feet
in relation with the Supreme Personality of Godhead
transcendental
by the sole purpose of serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead
very much attached to it
the symptoms of the results of such impious desires
knowing the result of becoming powerful as a king
of those who are against religious principles
the two ends of the flute
those devoted to Him
who has completely taken shelter of Him
His wife (Laksmi)
his wives
from the mouths of other inhabitants
the particular result of that
suitable pieces of fruit like bael
of all the fruits of that tree
maintaining that calf
by her influence
his master
by the influence of their husband (although they were unfit
because of associating with King Rantideva (when talking with him about bhakti-yoga)
from untimely discharge of that (baby deer)
by His grace
by the reflection of sunshine
the counteraction of such an illusory atmosphere
the counteraction (invented for stopping the suffering of material existence)
inimical to them
fixing on them
a tree of the love of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
and for His satisfaction
by eating the remnants of food from the great sacrifice
through the hole of the nostril
her life
in His presence
by engaging his life in the service of Krsna's representative
with Vaisnavas
from the son of him (Dhumraksa)
of His feet
the water that washed the lotus feet of the Lord
grasping their feet
at his feet
at His lotus feet
Lord Nrsimhadeva's lotus feet
of the lotus feet of His Lordship
exactly as the entire world is purified by the Ganges water emanating from the toe of Lord Visnu
of the Lord's lotus feet
at his lotus feet
the true nature of them
the attendants of Lord Siva
of his blood
by the blood of the sons of Kartaviryarjuna
by the transcendental mellow derived from that great literature
with the juice of the jambu fruits that flows in the river
of his chariot
the plunderers of his money
choking that process
of their attempt to stop the cows from going to their calves
by her charms
the reason why Lord Krsna (Kesava) assumed the form of Nrsimha
His form of body
in his kingdom
at night
the experience of fatigue and other miseries
by association with the prostitute of intelligence
being afraid of such material association
of men who are fond of women
by association with persons attached to women
her companions
as Your competitor
in that connection
who was generated from that lotus flower
by His hair
always eager to serve the Lord
being bound by their affection
because of increased love for the calves
by the bathing of them (the damsels of the heavenly planets)
that breast
His place
his son (Prahlada Maharaja)
her sons
His identity
his sister
the same condition of agitation as the mind
by the glaring effulgence of His body
cause of satisfying the Lord
for the protection of the brahmanas
one quarter of that measure (900
we cannot understand the actual truth
this is quite befitting him
by grass grown from that water
created by Him
being spoken by the boys
understanding everything rightly
over and above that
on the top of Lokaloka Mountain
the bosom of the Lord
and their descendants
under the control of him
her words
the only means of killing Him (Visnu)
various means for killing him
the killing of Hiranyaksa
killing of him
for the killing of him
whose color is the same as that of the mode of passion (reddish)
the ruler of that land
the inhabitants of Hari-varsa
of the ruler of that land
the residents of those tracts of land
like his father
their calves
by the youth of his son
seeing them all
which indicated the glorious activities of the Lord
the prowess of Hiranyaksa
prowess
various pastimes of the Lord
one who knows
of that kind
knowing very well the art of singing
of those who know the Supreme Lord
struck by the will of the Supreme

on the person who chants the holy name
in the subject of all those
just the opposite of that
just the opposite of our favor
the opposite of that (an exclamation of grief)
separation from her
thrown off by him
expert in that knowledge
accepting the vows of the husband or acting exactly as the husband acts
with persons of the same category (desiring liberation from material bondage)
by being separated from the Supersoul
who created an obstruction to the sun and moon at the time of the distribution of nectar
vocables

the words of Vasudeva
the words (of Kamsa)

the request of the sages
what is enjoyed by the demigods

of a male elephant
in groups
from the midst
by his own associates
O yuthi
assembled them
svarna-yuthis
O plant of yuthika flowers
young
newly youthful person
young man
even as a young man
youth
unto those who appear as young men
both of you
of the name Yuvanasva
of King Yuvanasva
young girl
appearing as a false young girl
their everlastingly youthful wives
the groups of young girls
all the young damsels of Vrajabhumi
of both of you
all of you
desiring to fight
quite fit
is not befitting
should not be spoken
one should not follow
is not fit to put on
fought
engaged
by the name Yuyudha
Yuyudhana
fought
fought
came into conflict
engaged
offered
you want to pierce
of those who are belligerent
the son of Dhrtarastra by his vaisya wife
all in fighting spirit
