Om is the closest word to Brahman . Recite this Om as if you are worshipping Brahman. That is, treat this Om as the symbol of Brahman and concentrate on the idea of their oneness. How you recite this Om is being explained.
The earth is the essence of all things, living or non-living; water is the essence of the earth; plants are the essence of water; human beings are the essence of plants; speech is the essence of human beings; the Ṛg Veda is the essence of speech; the Sāma Veda is the essence of the Ṛg Veda; and the udhītha is the essence of the Sāma Veda.
This udgītha Om is the best of all essences. It is the best of all that exists. It is the eighth, and it has the highest status.
Which are the Ṛks? Which are the Sāmas ? Which are the udgīthas ? This is the question.
In answer to the foregoing question: Speech is the same as Ṛk; prāṇa life is the same as Sāma ; and Om is nothing but udgītha Brahman itself. They are pairs: speech and life, Ṛk and Sāma.
This dual combination of speech and life merge into each other and become one in this syllable Om. It is like a male and a female meeting and satisfying each other’s desires.
He who worships Om as the udgītha Brahman , knowing it as the one who receives everything, himself finally receives everything he desires.
That akṣaram Om stands for assent. A person says Om whenever he wants to say yes. This Om is the key to progress. He who worships Om as the udgītha Brahman , knowing it thus as the fulfiller of all desires, has all his desires fulfilled.
With Om one begins the threefold Vedic ritual, and with Om one starts reciting the Vedas . With Om one starts singing the Vedic hymns, and again with Om one sings the udgān from the Vedas, in praise of Om, or Brahman . All this is a tribute to Om. Again, all this is possible by virtue of the essence derived from Om in the form of wheat and other food.
He who knows about Om and he who does not know about it both work with strength they derive from Om. But knowledge and ignorance produce different results. Anything done with knowledge about Om, with faith in the teachers and in the scriptures, and according to the principles of the Upaniṣads or of yoga is more fruitful. This certainly is the right tribute to Om.
The gods and goddesses and the demons are both children of Prajāpati , yet they fought among themselves. The gods and goddesses then adopted the path of the udgītha , thinking they would thereby be able to overcome the demons.
The gods and goddesses worshipped the prāṇa presiding over the nostrils as udgītha . The demons, however, misused it. To them it was only an organ of smelling. That is why because of this misuse people smell both good and bad odours through the nostrils.
Next the gods and goddesses worshipped speech as udgītha i.e., they used speech in praise of Om. The demons, however, pierced it with evil i.e., misused it out of ignorance. This is why people use the organ of speech to speak both truth and untruth. This happens beacuse speech was pierced with evil.
Next the gods and goddesses worshipped the eye as udgītha as a praise to Om. The demons, however, pierced it with evil i.e., misused it out of ignorance. This is why people see both good and bad things with the eyes. They see both because of ignorance.
Next the gods and goddesses worshipped the faculty of hearing as udgītha in order to praise Om. The demons, however, pierced it with evil i.e., misused it out of ignorance. As a result, people hear both pleasant and unpleasant things with the ears. This happens because of ignorance.
Next, the gods and goddesses worshipped the mind, because the mind makes it possible for them to chant the udgītha the praise to Om. But the demons even vitiated the mind. As a result, the mind has both good and bad thoughts. This happens because of ignorance.
Next, the gods and goddesses worshipped the chief prāṇa as udgītha . As regards the demons, they all met their end in prāṇa, just as chunks of earth break into pieces when they hit an unbreakable stone.
Just as when chunks of earth are thrown against an unbreakable stone they are themselves reduced to dust, similarly, if anyone wishes ill or causes an injury to a person who knows prāṇa , he invites his own destruction thereby. The person who knows prāṇa is immune to injury like a piece of unbreakable stone.
So far as the chief prāṇa is concerned, there is no good or bad odour for it. This is because it is pure i.e., it is never touched by anything evil born of egotism. If this prāṇa eats and drinks anything, it does so only to sustain the sense organs such as the eyes, the ears, and so on. When death occurs, the chief prāṇa does not eat or drink anything and as a result, the sense organs collapse. They seem to have left the body. They still want to eat and drink, however, so that they may live, and this is indicated by the fact that a person dies with the mouth open.
The sage Aṅgirā worshipped the chief prāṇa as udgītha i.e., Brahman , to whom the udgītha is addressed. The chief prāṇa is referred to as āṅgirasa , for it is the rasa i.e., the essence, or support of all the aṅgas organs.
This is why Bṛhaspati worshipped prāṇa as udgītha . Prāṇa is regarded as Bṛhaspati, for vāk speech is great bṛhatī and prāṇa is its lord pati .
This is why Āyāsya worshipped prāṇa as udgītha . They regarded this as Āyāsya for it is that which comes ayate out of the mouth āsyāt .
The sage Baka , son of Dalbha, came to know prāṇa as it was. That is why the sages of Naimiṣa forest selected him as the singer of their udgītha . He, in his turn, fulfilled their wishes.
If a person knows the real meaning of prāṇa and worships it as udgītha akṣara i.e., as Akṣara Brahman he himself becomes Akṣara Brahman. He then worships everyone he wants to worship i.e., in singing for prāṇa he sings for all, and he attains all he desires. This is the attainment on the level of the body adhyātma . The inner attainment is that he becomes one with prāṇa—that is, Akṣara Brahman.
Next, how you worship from the standpoint of the forces of nature: There is the sun rising to give us heat. Worship it as udgītha . The sun rises to pray, as it were, for the welfare of all living beings. As it rises, it dispels the fear of darkness. One who knows this overcomes the fear of ignorance about birth and death.
This prāṇa and that sun are alike. Prāṇa is warm, and the sun is also warm. Prāṇa is called svara when it is ‘going out’ at the time of death. The sun is also described as svara when it ‘sets’ and pratyāsvara when it ‘comes back’. Therefore, worship both prāṇa and the sun as udgītha .
Worship vyāna the breath held between prāṇa and apāna that enables you to speak as udgītha . Prāṇa is the breath drawn in and apāna is the breath drawn out. Vyāna is the breath held between prāṇa and apāna. This vyāna is also called vāk speech, for in speaking a person has to hold the breath.
Whatever is vāk speech is also the Ṛk part of the Ṛg Veda . This is why a person stops breathing in and breathing out when reciting the Ṛk mantras . Whatever is the Ṛk is also the Sāma . This is why one recites the Sāma without breathing in or breathing out. That which is the Sāma is also the udgītha . This is why when one sings the udgītha one stops both breathing in and breathing out.
This is why, while doing feats demanding great strength—such as producing a fire by rubbing one stick of wood against another, running up to a target, or bending a stiff bow—a person does not breathe in or breathe out. For this reason, one should worship this holding of breath, called vyāna , as udgītha Om.
Now, one should worship the syllables ut, gī and tha separately in the word udgītha . Prāṇa is represented by ut , for prāṇa is responsible for the
Heaven is ut , the space between heaven and the earth is gī , and the earth is tha . The sun is ut , air is gī , and fire is tha . The Sāma Veda is ut , the Yajur Veda is gī , and the Ṛg Veda is tha . The scriptures reveal their meaning to the seeker if he knows all this. One who worships ut-gī-tha as above gets plenty of food and also eats plenty of food. Such a person also gets enlightenment.
Now here are instructions about how one attains one’s desired objectives: Keep meditating on the objectives. Also, pray for the objectives by singing the appropriate Sāma , and remember that the Sāma is the source of the things you are asking for.
The Ṛk from which this Sāma is derived, the sage who conceived of this Sāma prayer, and the deity to whom the prayer is addressed—meditate on all of them.
One may use the Gāyatrī or some other hymn when praying, but one should meditate on it. Again, one may use a number of Sāma mantras while praying, but one must meditate on them along with the deities to whom they are addressed.
No matter what direction one may face while praying, one should meditate on that direction along with the presiding deities of that direction.
Finally, as a person ends his prayer, he should ask for whatever he desires, making sure, however, that his pronunciation is correct. He should also think of himself including his name, lineage, and caste. Then whatever desire he has while praying is promptly and surely fulfilled.
Om is the closest word to Brahman . Recite this Om as if you are worshipping Brahman. That is, treat this Om as the symbol of Brahman and concentrate on the idea of their oneness. How you recite this Om is being explained.
The gods and goddesses were afraid of death, so they took refuge in the rites and rituals of the three Vedas . They covered themselves, as it were, with mantras . Because they covered themselves with mantras, the mantras came to be known as chandas .
Just as a person can see a fish swimming in shallow water i.e., the fish is exposed to the risk of being caught, in the same way, Death could see the gods and goddesses when they depended on Vedic rituals i.e., they were in easy reach of Death. Realizing this, the gods and goddesses switched over to the recitation of Om.
When people recite the Ṛk, they start with Om, reciting it with great enthusiasm. They do the same when they recite the Sāma and Yajus . This Om is akṣara and also svara . It is a symbol of immortality and fearlessness. When the gods and goddesses took refuge in it, they attained immortality and fearlessness.
Even now anyone who knows this Om and worships it thus can attain the fearlessness and immortality of Om, which is akṣara , or svara . By becoming one with Om, a person can attain immortality, just as the gods and goddesses did.
That which is udgītha is also praṇava Om. So also, that which is praṇava is udgītha. That sun is udgītha, and it is also praṇava, because it seems to say Om or, has the word Om in its mind when it appears.
The sage Kauṣītaki said to his son: ‘I worshipped the sun and its rays as one. That is why I had only one son, which is you. If you worship the sun and its rays separately, you will then have many children.’ This is the worship of the forces of nature.
Next, this is how worship concerning the physical body is performed: One should worship the chief prāṇa as udgītha , for it seems to say Om as it makes the organs of perception and action function.
The sage Kauṣītaki said to his son: ‘I worshipped prāṇa as just one entity, and therefore I had only one son. I suggest that you worship prāṇa as one with manifold qualities and with many forms while thinking, “May my children be many”’.
For certain, that which is udgītha is praṇava , and that which is praṇava is also udgītha. Should the person performing a sacrifice make mistakes in pronunciation, that can be rectified when he has the knowledge that udgītha and praṇava are the same.
This earth is like the Ṛg Veda , and fire is like the Sāma Veda . The Sāma is based on the Ṛg Veda, and this is why the Sāṃa is sung based on the Ṛg Veda. The earth is sā and fire is ama . This sā and ama together make Sāma .
The space between heaven and earth is the Ṛk, and air is the Sāma . This Sāma called air is based on the Ṛk called the space between heaven and earth. This is why the Sāma is sung based on the Ṛk. The space between heaven and earth is sā , and earth is ama . Together they are Sāma.
Heaven is the Ṛk, and the sun is the Sāma . This Sāma called the sun is based on the Ṛk called heaven. This is why Sāma scholars sing songs based on the Ṛk. Heaven is sā , and the sun is ama . Together they are Sāma.
The stars are the Ṛk, and the moon is the Sāma . This Sāma called the moon is based on the Ṛk called the stars. This is why Sāma scholars sing songs based on the Ṛk. The stars are the sā , and the moon is ama . Together they are Sāma.
The white glow of the sun is the Ṛk, and its deep blue glow is the Sāma . The black glow called the Sāma is based on the white glow called the Ṛk. That is why the Sāma is sung based on the Ṛk.
Then, worship of the effulgent being in the sun: The white glow of the sun is sā , and the dark bluish-black glow is ama . These two together make up the word Sāma . There is a deity within the orb of the sun, who is seen by yogīs . His whole body glitters like gold, even to his toe-nails. He has a bright golden beard and bright golden hair.
His eyes are like lotuses blossomed by the sun. He is called ut because he is above all weakness. He who knows this truth is also above all weakness.
The Ṛk and the Sāma are his two singers who sing in praise of this god. This is why he is called udgītha , and this is why a singer of the udgītha is called an udgātā . There are worlds above the solar region, but the god in the solar region rules over them and also supports them. He also decides the wishes of the gods and goddesses. This is from the standpoint of the gods and goddesses.
Now an explanation with reference to the body: Speech is Ṛk, and prāṇa is Sāma . This Sāma called prāṇa is based on the Ṛk called speech. This is why Sāma scholars sing songs based on the Ṛk. Speech is sā , and prāṇa is ama . Together they are Sāma.
The eyes are like the Ṛg Veda , and the self i.e., the form seen in the eyes is like the Sāma , which is based on the Ṛk. This is why the Sāma is sung based on the Ṛk. The eyes are the sā , and the self the form in the eyes is the ama . The two together are Sāma.
The organ of hearing is the Ṛk, and the mind is Sāma . This Sāma called the mind is based on the Ṛk called the organ of hearing. This is why Sāma scholars sing songs based on the Ṛk. The organ of hearing is sā , and the mind is ama . Together they are Sāma.
Further, there is a white glow in the eyes, and this is compared with the Ṛg Veda . Then there is a similar glow which is a deep, dark blue. This is compared to the Sāma Veda . This dark glow is based on the white glow. This is why the Sāma is said to be based on the Ṛk. Sā of Sāma stands for the white glow in the eye, and ama stands for the deep blue glow. These two together are Sāma.
The person seen in the eye is the Ṛk, the Sāma , the uktha a part of the Sāma, and the Yajus . He is also the three Vedas . The person who is in the sun and the person who is in the eye are the same. The same two singers i.e., the Ṛk and the Sāma sing in praise of each of them, and they have the same names.
The person in the eye rules the world below him and also rules the desires of the human mind. Those who sing accompanied by the vīṇā , are, in fact, singing in his honour. This is why such musicians become wealthy.
This is what a worshipper achieves: He who knows the Truth mentioned above i.e., the Truth about Āditya , the sun, sings the Sāma in honour of both Āditya and the person in the eye. He then becomes one with Āditya. Not only that, he also attains mastery of the planes above Āditya and attains everything the gods and goddesses wish for. In other words, such a person becomes divine.
Now, the same worshipper also attains, by the grace of the Lord in the eye, all the worlds below that Lord. Again, he attains all that human beings may desire. This is why the singer will ask:
A learned udgātā , who sings the Sāma , will ask the person for whose benefit he is singing: ‘What shall I ask for on your behalf through my songs?’ He says this because he knows the Lord in the eye presides over the Sāma and is capable of granting whatever the person wants and he sings the Sāma, he sings the Sāma.
In ancient times, these three—Śilaka, the son of Salāvat, Caikitāyana, the son of Cikitāyana of the Dalbha clan, and Pravāhaṇa, the son of Jīvala—were skilled in the art of the udgītha . They said: ‘We have mastered the art of the udgītha. If you so wish, we can discuss the udgītha’.
They said, ‘Let it be so,’ and then sat down. Pravāhaṇa, the son of Jīvala, said: ‘You two may please begin the debate. I would like to listen to the debate between you two brāhmins’.
Śalāvat’s son Śilaka said to the sage Caikitāyana Dālbhya , ‘If you permit, I would like to ask you a question.’ Dālbhya replied, ‘Yes, ask’.
Śilaka asked, ‘What is the support of Sāma ?’ ‘It is the voice,’ replied Dālbhya . ‘What is the support of the voice?’ ‘The vital breath,’ answered Dālbhya. ‘What is the support of the vital breath?’ asked Śilaka. Dālbhya replied, ‘Food.’ Then Śilaka asked, ‘What is the support of food?’ Dālbhya said, ‘Water’.
Śilaka: ‘What is the support of water?’ Dālbhya : ‘That world, heaven.’ Śilaka: ‘What is the support of that world?’ Dālbhya: ‘Don’t go beyond that heaven. We know Sāma is in heaven, and this is why Sāma is respected as heaven’.
Śilaka Śālāvatya said to Caikitāyana Dālbhya : ‘O Dālbhya, your Sāma is then without a base. If someone knowledgeable about Sāma would now say that your statement is wrong, and if he curses you saying, “Your head will fall if what you say turns out to be wrong,” your head will really fall’.
Dālbhya said, ‘Sir, if you permit, I would like to ask you about this.’ Śilaka replied, ‘Yes, ask.’ Dālbhya then asked, ‘What is the support of that heaven?’ Śilaka said, ‘This earth.’ ‘What supports this earth?’ asked Dālbhya. Śilaka replied: ‘Don’t think Sāma ’s base is beyond this earth. We think Sāma is based on this earth, and we respect it as so’.
Pravāhaṇa Jaivali said: ‘O Śālāvatya , your Sāma is not endless. If someone should now say that your head will fall off, it will fall off.’ Śilaka Śālāvatya then said, ‘O Lord, I want to learn from you the truth about the Sāma.’ Jaivali replied, ‘Yes, learn from me’.
Śilaka Śālāvatya asked Pravāhaṇa, ‘What is the end of this earth?’ Pravāhaṇa said: ‘Space, for everything that exists arises from space and also goes back into space. Space is superior to everything. Space is the highest goal’.
Earlier, mention was made of the udgītha being the best as also endless. He who is aware of this and worships the udgītha as such keeps attaining higher and higher worlds, and he becomes increasingly a better individual.
In ancient times there was a sage named Atidhanvā, who was the son of Śunaka and who knew the science of udgītha very well. Once when he was teaching this to his disciple Udaraśāṇḍilya, he declared: ‘So long as you and your family preserve this knowledge, the quality of life in the world of your family will be higher than that of average people’.
As in this world, so also in the other world. He who knows the place of the udgītha and worships it accordingly enjoys the best in life in this world, and he enjoys the best in life in the other world also after death.
Once the land of the Kurus was hit by a bad thunderstorm, and a young man living there named Uṣasti, the son of Cakra , was in great distress. He left home accompanied by his child-wife and moved to a prosperous village.
Uṣasti saw an elephant-driver eating some pulses of poor quality, and he begged for a share of his food. The elephant-driver replied: ‘This food in my bowl is all I have to eat. Besides this, I have nothing. What should I do?’.
Uṣasti said to the elephant-driver, ‘Please give me some of the pulses.’ The driver then gave away the pulses and said, ‘Here is some water.’ But Uṣasti declined it, saying, ‘That will amount to my drinking unclean water’.
The elephant-driver asked, ‘Aren’t the pulses also unclean?’ Uṣasti replied: ‘I would die if I did not have these grains to eat. As regards drinking water, it is not that important. I can get it when I like’.
After eating some of the food, he Uṣasti brought back what was left for his wife. The wife, however, had meanwhile obtained good alms. She accepted the food from her husband and put it aside for future use.
While leaving bed the next morning, Uṣasti said to his wife: ‘Oh, if only I could get something to eat, I could then earn some money. The king over there is going to perform a sacrifice, and very likely he would have entrusted to me all the work of a ṛtvik a priest at a sacrifice’.
The wife said to him, ‘O dear husband, here are those pulses you gave me.’ Having eaten the pulses, Uṣasti left for the place where the sacrifice was being held other priests having already started it.
There at the sacrifice, he found those the udgātṛs who were singing the Sāma hymns and took a seat among them. Turning to the one who was singing the prastāva , he asked:
‘O Prastotā , if you recite the prastāva without knowing anything about the god to whom this hymn relates, your head will fall’.
Next Uṣasti said the same thing to the person singing the udgītha : ‘O Udgātā , if you do not know anything about the god related to the udgītha and yet you sing the udgītha, your head will fall’.
He again said the same thing to the person singing the pratihāra : ‘O Pratihartā , if you sing the pratihāra without knowing anything about the deity relating to it, your head will fall.’ At this, they stopped their respective hymns and remained silent.
Then the prince performing the sacrifice said, ‘Sir, I would like to know who you are.’ He Uṣasti replied, ‘I am Uṣasti, the son of Cakra ’.
He the prince said: ‘I looked for you, revered sir, to give you all the work of the priests. As I could not find you, I entrusted the work to other brāhmins’.
The prince said, ‘O Lord, please do for me all the work of the priest.’ Uṣasti replied: ‘Let it be so. Now let the priests already engaged by you recite as I instruct. But you will have to pay me as much as you promised to pay these priests.’ ‘It will be so,’ said the prince.
Then the Prastotā came to Uṣasti and said: ‘Revered sir, you told me, “O Prastotā, if you sing the prastāva without knowing anything about the deity to whom the hymn is addressed, your head will fall.” Please tell me who that deity is’.
Uṣasti said: ‘It is prāṇa the vital force. In prāṇa all things that we see around us moving or unmoving, disappear at the time of their destruction. And at the time of their appearance, they appear from prāṇa. Prāṇa is that deity to whom the prastāva is addressed. If you had sung the hymn not knowing the deity to whom it is addressed, in spite of being warned by me, your head would surely have fallen’.
Then the udgātā came to Uṣasti and said: ‘Revered sir, you told me, “O Udgātā, if you sing the udgītha without knowing anything about the deity to whom the hymn is addressed, your head will fall.” Please tell me who that deity is’.
Uṣasti said: ‘It is āditya the sun, for all these beings pay homage to the sun, which is high above. Āditya is that deity to whom the udgītha is addressed. If you had sung the udgītha not knowing the deity to whom it is addressed, your head would surely have fallen, as I had told you’.
Next, the pratihartā came to Uṣasti and said: ‘Revered sir, you told me, “O Pratihartā, if you sing the pratihāra without knowing anything about the deity to whom the hymn is addressed, your head will fall.” Please tell me who that deity is’.
Uṣasti said: ‘It is anna food, for all these beings support themselves by eating food. Anna is that deity to whom the pratihāra is addressed. If you had sung the pratihāra not knowing the deity to whom it is addressed, your head would surely have fallen, as I had told you’.
Now, an udgītha to food sung by dogs. The story is: Baka Dālbhya , who was also known as Glāva Maitreya , went one day to a quiet place to study the scriptures the udgītha.
A white dog appeared before him, as if he wanted to do the sage a favour. Then several other smaller dogs came to the white dog and said: ‘O Lord, please sing for us. We are hungry and we want some food’.
The white dog replied, ‘All of you meet me here tomorrow morning.’ Baka Dālbhya , who was also known as Glāva Maitreya , waited there too for the white dog.
Just as those who recite the hymn called bahiṣpavamāna move forward while touching each other, so the dogs also did the same. Then, sitting down, they said him .
‘Om, we will eat. Om, we will drink. Om, Deva the sun, Varuṇa , Prajāpati , Savitā , bring us food here. O Lord of food the sun, bring us food here. Bring us food here. Om’.
This planet, the earth, is represented by the syllable hāu , air is represented by the syllable hāi , the moon
Āditya , the sun, is represented by the stobha ū ; nihava, the welcoming hymn, by the stobha e ; the Viśvadeva gods by the stobha auhoyi ; Prajāpati by the stobha hiṃ ; prāṇa by the stobha svara ; food by the stobha yā ; and Virāṭ by the stobha vāk .
The thirteenth stobha huṃ is not clearly defined. Various scholars have defined it in various ways. Thus, it is up to people to meditate on it as they like.
To a person who knows the Sāma with its stobhas, as mentioned earlier, the organ of speech gives of its best. Such a person gets plenty of food to eat and can also eat much food.
It is good to worship the Sāma with all its parts. All that is good, according to scholars, is called sāma . Similarly, all that is bad is asāma .
This is why people say, ‘He has succeeded in getting access to that distinguished person by virtue of sāma ,’ when they mean he has gone to that distinguished person by honest and legitimate means. Similarly, they say, ‘By virtue of asāma he went to that distinguished person,’ when they mean he got to that person by unethical means.
Then when something good happens, people say, ‘It is sāma for us,’ when they mean that it is good for them. But when something bad happens, people say, ‘It is asāma for us,’ when they mean that it is bad for them.
If a person knows the Sāma as such and worships it with the awareness of the great qualities it possesses, those qualities very soon manifest themselves in him and become a source of happiness.
One should worship the Sāma in a fivefold manner, treating the different parts as symbols of the worlds.
Now, the fivefold worship from the highest world to the lowest: heaven is hiṃkāra, the sun is prastāva , the sky is udgītha , fire is pratihāra , and the earth is nidhana .
He who worships Sāma with the above knowledge, and worships it in the fivefold manner as described, has all these worlds, from the lowest to the highest and from the highest to the lowest, for his enjoyment.
One can perform the fivefold Sāma worship during the rain. Think of the wind that comes before the rain as hiṃkāra. The clouds that gather are the prastāva , and the rain that follows is the udgītha . Then, when the lightning flashes and the thunder roars, that is pratihāra .
When the rain stops, that is the nidhana . If a person performs the fivefold Sāma worship, keeping all this in mind, clouds favour him with rain as he likes when the rain is due, and they may do him this favour even when rain is not due.
One can perform the fivefold Sāma worship in all kinds of water. The coming together of scattered clouds is hiṃkāra. That which pours forth rain is the prastāva . The udgītha is that river running eastward, and that which runs westward is the pratihāra . The sea is the nidhana .
He who performs the fivefold Sāma worship in all forms of water, knowing it thus, will never be drowned in water unless he wishes to be, and he will have as much water as he wants.
One can apply the same fivefold Sāma worship formula to the seasons. Treat spring as hiṃkāra, summer as the prastāva , the rainy season as the udgītha , autumn as the pratihāra , and winter as the nidhana .
To the person who knows this principle of the fivefold Sāma worship and applies it to the seasons thus, the seasons become a source of enjoyment, and the best things that each of them has to offer present themselves to him.
This is how a person can perform the fivefold Sāma worship in animals. Think of goats as hiṃkāra, sheep as the prastāva , cows as the udgītha , horses as the pratihāra , and human beings as the nidhana .
He who performs the fivefold Sāma worship in animals, knowing it in this way, gets many animals for his enjoyment, and he also has a large number of animals as his personal wealth.
One should perform the fivefold worship of Sāma in the organs in an increasingly higher way. The organ of smell is hiṃkāra, the organ of speech is the prastāva , the eyes are the udgītha , the ears are the pratihāra , and the mind is the nidhana . These organs should be worshipped, each with greater respect than the previous one.
When a person knows the fivefold Sāma worship and performs it in the organs, paying to each of the organs more respect than to the last, his life becomes more and more excellent, and he also attains better and better worlds.
Now begins a discussion on the sevenfold Sāma worship. One can perform this sevenfold Sāma worship in speech. Wherever the syllable huṃ occurs in speech, that is hiṃkāra. Similarly, wherever the syllable pra occurs, that is to be taken for the prastāva . And wherever ā occurs, that is ādi the beginning.
Wherever the syllable ut occurs, that is the udgītha . Where there is prati , that is the pratihāra . Where you find upa , that is the upadrava. And where you find ni , that is the nidhana .
He who knows Sāma in this way, and performs the sevenfold Sāma worship in speech, gets from speech whatever good things it has to offer. He also gets plenty of food to eat, and he eats that food and thereby looks radiant in health.
Next, without fail, worship the sevenfold Sāma in the sun. The sun is the Sāma because it is always the same. Again, the sun makes each of us think, ‘It is looking at me. It is looking at me.’ Because it is the same to all, it is called Sāma .
One should know that all beings that exist are dependent on the sun. The sun has a distinctive look before it rises, and that look is its hiṃkāra. The animals, who are dependent on the sun, also have their share in this hiṃkāra. That is why they make the sound hiṃ .
Next, the form that the sun has shortly after it rises is the prastāva . Human beings are charmed by that form. Because they join in the praise and adoration of the prastāva, they seek adoration and praise for themselves.
Next, when the sun-rays spread all over a short while after sunrise, that form of the sun is the ādi of the Sāma . This form is connected with the birds. They somehow or other feel they have a safe shelter then, and that is why they are able to fly freely about in the sky without any support. They also behave as if they are joining in the ādi offered to the Sāma.
Next, that form of the sun which it has exactly at noon is the udgītha . That form is connected with the gods and goddesses. Therefore, among all of Prajāpati ’s children, the gods and goddesses are considered to be the best, because they take part in singing the udgītha of the Sāma .
Next, between the noon and the afternoon, the sight the sun presents is that of the pratihāra . The foetuses in the wombs are attached to this pratihāra. This is why they are held up and do not drop down, and why they are entitled to take part in the pratihāra addressed to the Sāma .
Next, the form that the sun has between the afternoon and sunset is called the upadrava. Wild animals are fond of this form, for when the sun is in that position, the wild animals are able to scurry away into the forest or into their holes if they see a human being. These animals are also able to take part in the upadrava to the Sāma .
Next, the nidhana is the form of the sun as it sets. The ancestors love this form of the sun, and this is why, as the sun sets, offerings are made to them or, are placed on straws in honour of them at the time the śrāddha rites are performed. For this reason, the ancestors participate in the nidhana in honour of the Sāma . This is how the sun is offered the sevenfold Sāma worship.
After worshipping the Sāma as the sun, one should perform the sevenfold Sāma worship by using words of the same number of syllables. By this one overcomes death. The word hiṃkāra has three syllables; so also,
The word ādi is two-syllabled, and the word pratihāra is four-syllabled. If you take away one syllable from pratihāra and add it to ādi , then they will have the same number of syllables.
The word udgītha has three syllables. The word upadrava has four syllables. If they are taken as three-syllabled they are equal. In that case, the syllable va in upadrava becomes superfluous. They are equal so far as their three syllables are concerned.
The word nidhana has three syllables. All words, having three syllables each, are the same when used in praise of the Sāma . All these together have twenty-two syllables.
With the help of those twenty-one syllables, one can attain the status of the sun which is also Death. The sun occupies the twenty-first place after the things that come between the earth and the sun those things being the twelve months, the five seasons, and the three worlds. One can then go beyond the sun if one knows the twenty-second syllable. That world is full of joy and free from all sorrows.
If a person knows all about the Sāma , and performs the sevenfold Sāma worship, treating the Sāma as himself and as something beyond death, he wins the state of the sun and then wins a place even higher than the sun.
The mind is hiṃkāra, the organ of speech is the prastāva , the eyes are the udgītha , the ears are the pratihāra , and the vital breath in its fine (five?) forms is the nidhana . The Gāyatrī prayer is controlled by the vital breath.
This Gāyatra Sāma is rooted in the prāṇas . He who knows this becomes full of vitality, has a long life, and his life is brilliant. Also, he is fortunate in his children, and he has many domestic animals. He is one of the most famous people. To be noble-minded is the aim of his life.
When one rubs two pieces of wood against each other to light a fire, that is the hiṃkāra. When it produces smoke, that is the prastāva . Then when the flame appears, that is the udgītha . The charcoals that result are the pratihāra , and when the fire begins to go out, that is the nidhana . When the flame is completely extinguished, that also is the nidhana. This Sāma called Rathantara is rooted in fire.
He who knows that this Rathantara Sāma is rooted in fire, acquires the kind of glow that Vedic scholarship produces. He also enjoys eating. He lives the full span of his life, and his life is brilliant. He is well known for his children and for his animal wealth, and he commands great respect in society. His vow is that he will never eat with fire in front of him and he will never spit.
1-2.
The rising sun is the hiṃkāra, the sun that has already risen is the prastāva , the midday sun is the udgītha , the afternoon sun is the pratihāra , and the setting sun is the nidhana . This Sāma called Bṛhat is based on the sun.
He who knows that the Sāma called Bṛhat is rooted in the sun is spirited and has a great appetite. He lives the full span of his life, has a brilliant career, and is renowned for his children and for his animal wealth. His success in life brings him much fame. The vow he observes is that he will never utter a word against the sun, which gives us heat.
When light clouds consolidate, that is the hiṃkāra. When clouds likely to pour rain collect, that is the prastāva . When the rain begins, that is the udgītha . Then there are flashes of lightning and the roar of thunder. This is the pratihāra . When it all stops, that is the nidhana . This Sāma called Vairūpa is rooted in the clouds.
He who knows that this Sāma called Vairūpa has its source in the clouds comes to acquire a large variety of animals, and all beautiful animals too. He has a long and brilliant life, and his children and animals are such that he becomes famous for them. His achievements also mark him as a great person.
Spring is the hiṃkāra, summer the prastāva , the rainy season the udgītha , autumn the pratihāra , and winter the nidhana . This Sāma known as Vairāja is rooted in the seasons.
He who knows that the Sāma called Vairāja is rooted in the seasons is surrounded by his children and animals and has a radiance about him which is born of Vedic scholarship. He lives a long and brilliant life, and he is considered great for his children and for his animals. He is also highly respected for his great deeds. He follows the vow of never criticizing the seasons.
The earth is the hiṃkāra, the space between the earth and heaven is the prastāva , heaven is the udgītha , the quarters are the pratihāra , and the ocean is the nidhana . The Sāma known as Śakvarī is rooted in the earth and other worlds.
He who knows that the Sāma known as Śakvarī is located in the worlds goes to the best world. He also has a long and brilliant life and is well known for his children and for his animal wealth. He is considered to be a great person because of his great deeds. He takes a vow that he will never criticize the worlds.
Goats are the hiṃkāra, sheep are the prastāva , cows represent the udgītha , horses are the pratihāra , and a human being is the nidhana . The Sāma called Revatī is established in animals.
He who knows that the Sāma called Revatī is rooted in animals acquires many animals. He has a long and brilliant life and becomes well known for his children and for his animal wealth. He also becomes a truly great person for his great deeds. His vow is that he will never say anything bad about animals.
Hair is the hiṃkāra, skin is the prastāva , flesh is the udgītha , bone is the pratihāra , and marrow is the nidhana . The Sāma called Yajñāyajñīya is spread all over the limbs of the body.
He who knows that the Sāma known as Yajñāyajñīya is located in different parts of the body becomes possessed of a firm body and none of his organs has any defect. He has a long and brilliant life; and he becomes great because of his children and his animal wealth. He also becomes famous for his great deeds. His vow is that he will not eat meat for one whole year, or he will not eat it at all.
Fire is the hiṃkāra, air is the prastāva , the sun is the udgītha , the stars are the pratihāra , and the moon is the nidhana . This Sāma known as Rājana is rooted in the gods and goddesses.
He who knows that the Sāma known as Rājana is established in the gods and goddesses shares the same worlds with these gods and goddesses, has the same rights and privileges with them, or has the same form. He also has a long and brilliant life. And he becomes great by virtue of his children and his animal wealth, and also by virtue of his great deeds. His vow is that he will never speak ill of the brāhmins.
The three vidyās the Ṛk, the Yajuḥ , and the Sāma are together the hiṃkāra; these three worlds the earth, the space between the earth and heaven, and heaven are together the prastāva ; fire, air, and the sun are together the udgītha ; the stars, the birds, and the rays are together the pratihāra ; serpents, gandharvas , and the ancestors are together the nidhana . This Sāma resides in everything.
He who knows that this Sāma is in everything becomes one with everything or, becomes the Lord of everything.
Here is a verse in this connection: There are five parts of Sāma , and each of these is divided into three parts. There is nothing higher than these fifteen forms of Sāma.
He who knows Sāma knows everything, and gifts come to him from all quarters. His vow will be to constantly say to himself, ‘I am one with all’.
The vinardi voice for singing the Sāma is good for animals, and Agni , the god of fire, is its presiding deity. I bear this in mind and pray that I may have this voice. The god Prajāpati presides over the udgītha sung in the anirukta unclear voice. The one having Soma as its presiding deity is nirukta clear. That of Vāyu , the god of air, is soft and pleasant, and Indra ’s is strong. That which has Bṛhaspati as its presiding deity is like the voice of the krauñca bird, and that of Varuṇa is like the sound of a broken metal pot. Cultivate all of these, but avoid the one of Varuṇa.
One should sing with the resolve: ‘By singing I will get immortality for the gods and goddesses, food offerings for the ancestors, hope for humanity, food and water for the animals, heaven for those who perform sacrifices, and food for myself. All this I will get by singing.’ Thinking thus, one should sing without raising the voice too much or, without being too excited.
All the vowels are like Indra ’s body with its various parts. The sibilants śa, ṣa , etc. are like Prajāpati ’s body with its various parts. The consonants, starting with ka , are the body and limbs of Death. If someone finds fault with the way the udgātā pronounces the vowels, he may say to that person: ‘As I began singing, I took refuge in Indra i.e., I sought Indra’s blessings. Ask him and he will give you the right answer to your criticism.’
Then, if someone finds fault with his pronunciation of the sibilants, the singer will say to him: ‘When I started singing I sought Prajāpati ’s blessings. He will therefore crush you.’ Then, if someone finds fault with his pronunciation of the consonants, the singer will say to him: ‘I sought Death’s protection while singing. He will therefore burn you to ashes’.
Each vowel should be articulated clearly and powerfully, and while doing so, you should think, ‘I will give some of my strength to Indra .’ The sibilants also should be uttered fully and distinctly, without sounding as if you are swallowing part of them or spitting them out. While uttering them, you should think, ‘I surrender myself to Prajāpati .’ Then each of the consonants also should be uttered separately and clearly, and while doing so, you should think, ‘I will save myself from death’.
There are three divisions of religion: The first comprises sacrifices, study, and charity; the second consists of austerities, such as fasting; and the third is the life of celibacy and living with the teacher in his house till death. People devoted to these three divisions of religion go to heaven after death. But one who is devoted to Brahman attains immortality.
Prajāpati i.e., Virāṭ thought about the worlds he would have. Out of his thinking, the three Vedas took shape. He then began to think about the Vedas. As a result of this thinking, the Vedas gave birth to the three vyāhṛtis : bhūḥ, bhuvaḥ , and svaḥ .
Prajāpati then meditated on those three vyāhṛtis bhūḥ, bhuvaḥ , and svaḥ. Out of the vyāhṛtis, which he thought about, emerged Oṃkāra . Just as a network of ribs is spread all over a leaf, similarly, Oṃkāra permeates every form of speech or, everything. All this is Oṃkāra. All this is Oṃkāra.
Those who believe in Brahman say: The morning savana is for the Vasus , the midday savana is for the Rudras , and the third, the evening savana, is for the Ādityas and the Viśvadevas i.e., all the gods and goddesses.
Where then is the place for the yajamāna one who performs a sacrifice? How can he who does not know that place perform a sacrifice? He who knows can perform a sacrifice.
Before starting the morning chant, the sacrificer sits behind the Gārhapatya fire facing north and sings the Sāma about the Vasus .
O Fire, please open the door for us—that is, make the path clear—so that we may see you for obtaining full control of the earth.
Then the sacrificer begins the offerings with this mantra : ‘O Agni , you are in this world. I salute you. Please acquire the right world for me, who am performing a sacrifice. I am ready to go to a world appropriate for one who performs sacrifices’.
‘I, the yajamāna , have run the full course of my life in this world.’ With these words, he will say, ‘ Svāhā ,’ and offer his oblation. Then he will rise, saying, ‘Please unbolt the door to the world for which I am destined.’ The Vasus then give him the ownership of the earth, which is the result of the savana performed in the morning.
Before starting the midday savana , the yajamāna sits behind the Dakṣiṇāgni fire, facing north. He then sings the Sāma addressed to the Rudras .
O Fire, please open the door for us—that is, make the path clear—so that we may see you for obtaining full control of the world of Virāṭ .
Then the sacrificer begins the offerings with this mantra : ‘O Vāyu , you are in the mid-region. I salute you. Please acquire the right world for me, who am performing a sacrifice. I am ready to go to a world appropriate for one who performs sacrifices’.
‘I, the yajamāna , have run the full course of my life in this world.’ With these words, he will say, ‘ Svāhā ,’ and offer his oblation. Then he will rise, saying, ‘Please unbolt the door to the world for which I am destined.’ The Rudras then give him the ownership of the mid-region, which is the result of the savana performed at midday.
Before starting the third i.e., the evening savana , the yajamāna sits behind the Āhavanīya fire, facing the north. He then sings the Sāma addressed to the Ādityas and the Viśvadevas.
Addressing the Ādityas : ‘O Fire, please open the door to the world i.e., heaven for us so that we may see you for attaining sovereignty’.
The earlier verse was addressed to the Ādityas . Now, addressing the Viśvadevas , the yajamāna says, ‘O Fire, please open the door to the world i.e., heaven for us so that we may see you for attaining sovereignty’.
Then the sacrificer begins the offerings with this mantra : ‘Salutations to those who are in heaven and other worlds, to the Ādityas and the Viśvadevas . May I acquire the yajamāna ’s world’.
‘I am ready to go to a world appropriate for one who performs sacrifices. I will live in this world after my death.’ Saying ‘ Svāhā ,’ he completes the sacrifice. Then he rises, praying, ‘May the bolt be removed’.
The Ādityas and the Viśvadevas then present to him, the sacrifices, the result of the third savana . He who knows this knows the true purport of the sacrifice.
The sun over there is honey to the gods. Heaven is the crossbeam, the mid-region is the beehive, and the rays are the eggs.
The rays of the sun in the east are the eastern honey-cells of the beehive. The Ṛk mantras are the bees, and the Ṛg Veda is the flower. The water from the sacrifice, such as the soma juice and other things is the nectar of the flower. These Ṛk mantras—
—stimulated this Ṛg Veda . Out of that Ṛg Veda so stimulated came fame, vitality, the power of the organs, energy, and the essence of food.
All this fame, etc. spread out to the sun and took shelter there. It is this that accounts for the red look of the sun.
Then the rays of the sun in the south are the southern honey-cells of the beehive. The Yajuh mantras are the bees, and the Yajur Veda is the flower. The water from the sacrifice, such as the soma juice and other things is nectar of the flower.
Those Yajuḥ mantras stimulated the Yajur Veda . Out of that Yajur Veda so stimulated came fame, vitality, the power of the organs, energy, and the essence of food.
All this fame, etc. spread out to the sun and took shelter there. It is this that accounts for the white look of the sun.
Then the rays of the sun in the west are the western honey-cells of the beehive. The Sāma mantras are the bees, and the Sāma Veda is the flower. The water from the sacrifice, such as the soma juice and other things is the nectar of the flower.
Those Sāma mantras stimulated the Sāma Veda . Out of that Sāma Veda so stimulated came fame, vitality, the power of the organs, energy, and the essence of food.
All this fame, etc. spread out to the sun and took shelter there. It is this that gives rise to the black spots in the sun.
Then the northern rays of the sun are the northern honey-cells of the beehive. The mantras envisioned by the sages Atharvā and Aṅgirā are the bees, and the Itihāsas and Purāṇas i.e., history and legends are the flower. The water from the sacrifice, such as the soma juice and other things is the nectar of the flower.
Those Atharvā - Aṅgirasā mantras stimulated the Itihāsas and Purāṇas i.e., the history and the legends. Out of that so stimulated emerged fame, vitality, the power of the organs, energy, and the essence of food.
All this fame, etc, spread out to the sun and took shelter there. It is this that gives rise to the deep black spots in the sun.
Next, the rays of the sun which are in the higher region are also its honey-cells in the higher region. The secret instructions are the bees, and Brahman praṇava is the flower. The water from the sacrifice is the nectar.
These very secret directions stimulated Brahman in the form of praṇava . Out of that so stimulated emerged fame, vitality, the power of the organs, energy, and the essence of food.
All this fame, etc. spread out to the sun and took shelter there. It is this that seems to be vibrating within the sun.
These colours red, etc. are the essence of all essences. The Vedas are the essence, and the colours are the essence of the Vedas. These colours are the nectar of the nectar the Vedas. The Vedas are the nectar and therefore eternal, but the colours are the nectar of the Vedas.
Led by fire, the Vasus enjoy the first nectar which is the red colour. As a matter of fact, the gods and goddesses neither eat nor drink. They are pleased merely by seeing the nectar.
They enter into this red colour of the sun, and they also come out of this colour, i.e., They look at this red colour and are satisfied. They make no effort to get it. Nevertheless, they are at times attracted to it and try to reach it.
He who knows this nectar thus, becomes one of the Vasus because only the Vasus know the meaning of this nectar. Led by fire, he then enjoys looking at the nectar and is happy. He goes into this colour and again comes out of it.
As long as the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, so long will that person enjoy the sovereignty and freedom of the Vasus .
With Indra as their leader, the Rudras enjoy the second nectar which is the white colour of the sun. As a matter of fact, the gods and goddesses neither eat nor drink. They are pleased merely by seeing the nectar.
They enter into this white colour of the sun, and they also come out of this colour.
He who knows this nectar thus, becomes a Rudra himself. With Indra as the leader, he looks at the nectar and is happy. He goes into this colour and again comes out of it.
As long as the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, twice that long will he who knows this rise in the south and set in the north. That person will also attain sovereignty and freedom like the Rudras.
With Varuṇa as their leader, the Ādityas enjoy the third nectar which is dark in colour. As a matter of fact, the gods and goddesses neither eat nor drink. They are pleased merely by seeing the nectar.
They enter into this dark colour of the sun, and they also come out of this colour.
He who knows this nectar thus, becomes one of the Ādityas . With Varuṇa as the leader, he enjoys the nectar by looking at it. He goes into this colour and again comes out of it.
As long as the sun rises in the south and sets in the north, twice that long will he who knows this rise in the west and set in the east. That person will also attain sovereignty and freedom like the Ādityas.
With Soma as their leader, the Maruts enjoy the fourth nectar which is deep black in colour. As a matter of fact, the gods and goddesses neither eat nor drink. They enjoy merely by seeing the nectar.
They enter into this deep black colour of the sun, and they also come out of this colour.
He who knows this nectar thus, becomes one of the Maruts . With Soma as the leader, he enjoys the nectar by looking at it. He goes into this colour and again comes out of it.
As long as the sun rises in the west and sets in the east, twice that long will he who knows this rise in the north and set in the south. That person will also attain sovereignty and freedom like the Maruts.
With Brahman in the form of praṇava , Om as their leader, the Sādhyas enjoy the fifth nectar that which seems to be trembling within the sun. As a matter of fact, the gods and goddesses neither eat nor drink. They enjoy merely by seeing the nectar.
They enter into this form of the sun which seems to be vibrating, and they also come out of this form.
He who knows this nectar thus, becomes one of the Sādhyas . With Brahman in the form of praṇava as the leader, he enjoys the nectar by looking at it. He goes into this form of the sun and again comes out of it.
As long as the sun rises in the north and sets in the south, twice that long will he who knows this rise above and set below. That person will also attain sovereighnt and freedom like the Sādhyas i.e., he can move up and down as he likes.
Next, after giving to all living beings the fruits of their work, the sun will be above such obligations. It will no longer rise nor set, and will stay by itself midway. Here is a verse on the subject:
In answer to a question—No, indeed, in Brahmaloka the sun never rose, nor did it ever set. O gods, listen and bear witness to me. What I am saying is true, and by it may I have no hindrance to my realization of Brahman .
For him who knows the secret teachings of Brahman there is no sunrise or sunset or day or night. For him there is always day i.e., light.
First, Brahmā taught this instruction on honey to Prajāpati . Then Prajāpati taught it to Manu , and Manu taught it to his children. The father Aruṇa then taught this knowledge of Brahman to his eldest son Uddālaka Āruṇi .
This knowledge of Brahman a father will pass on to his eldest son or to a competent resident student.
This should never be taught to anyone else, even if one is tempted with the whole world full of riches and surrounded by water. For this knowledge is more precious than that. This knowledge is surely more precious than that.
All that exists in this world, whatever there is, is gāyatrī . It is the word that is gāyatrī, for the word gives names to all things and it also tells them not to fear.
That which is this gāyatrī is that which is this earth. For all things moving or unmoving are attached to this earth and cannot get away from it.
That which is this earth is this human body, because all the prāṇas are based in this body and cannot exist independent of it.
That which is in this human body is in this human heart, for all these prāṇas are based in this heart and cannot exist independent of it.
The gāyatrī has four quarters, each being sixfold. This is what is stated in a Ṛk mantra :
Its glory is like this. But the glory of the puruṣa i.e., Brahman , who fills the whole world is still greater. All creatures constitute one quarter of him. The remaining three quarters are nectar in heaven.
7-9. That which is Brahman is also the space outside the body. That which is the space outside the body is also the space inside the body. And that which is the space inside the body is also the space within the heart. That treasure within the heart is full and unchanging. He who knows this is always full and not subject to change.
In the heart there are five doors guarded by the gods. The door in the east is prāṇa . It is also the eyes, and it is Āditya . Worship this as the source of brightness and food. He who knows this becomes bright and enjoys food.
Next, the southern door of the heart is vyāna . It is also the ears, and it is the moon. Worship it as the source of prosperity and fame. He who knows this becomes prosperous and famous.
Next, the western door of the heart is apāna . It is also vāk, and it is fire. Worship this Brahman in the form of apāna as the radiance of Brahman and as food. He who knows this becomes radiant with the light of Brahman and a great eater of food.
Next, the northern door of the heart is samāna . It is also the mind, and it is the god of rain. Worship this Brahman in the form of samāna as fame and beauty. He who knows this becomes famous and beautiful.
Next, the door at the top of the heart is udāna . It is also vāyu air, and it is ākāśa space. Worship this Brahman in the form of udāna as strength and greatness. He who knows this becomes strong and great.
These five prāṇas are themselves like Brahman , and they are the gatekeepers of heaven. Anyone who regards these prāṇas as Brahman and as the gatekeepers to heaven has a heroic child born in his family. Knowing these prāṇas as Brahman and as the gatekeepers of heaven, a person attains heaven himself.
Then, higher than this heaven, above the world, higher than everything, in the highest world, higher than which nothing exists—the light that shines there is the same light that is in a human being.
Here is proof of it: When you touch the body you can feel heat in it. There is also an audible proof of it: When you cover your ears you can hear a sound like a moving chariot, or like the bellowing of a bullock, or like a burning fire. A person should meditate on that light in the body as something that is seen and heard. He who knows this becomes a distinguished person—people want to see him and he is widely known.
All this is Brahman . Everything comes from Brahman, everything goes back to Brahman, and everything is sustained by Brahman. One should therefore quietly meditate on Brahman. Each person has a mind of his own. What a person wills in his present life, he becomes when he leaves this world. One should bear this in mind and meditate accordingly.
He is controlled by the mind i.e., his mind decides what he should and should not do. He has a subtle body, and he is luminous. If he wants something, he never fails to get it. His Self is spotless like the sky. The whole world is his creation. Desires are many, and all those desires are his desires. All odours are his; similarly, all tastes are his. He is everywhere in the world. He has no sense organs, and he is free from desires.
My Self within my heart is smaller than a grain of rice, smaller than a grain of barley, smaller than a mustard seed, smaller than a grain of millet, smaller even than the kernel of a grain of millet. The Self in my heart is larger than the earth, larger than the mid-region, larger than heaven, and larger even than all these worlds.
He who is the sole creator, whose desires are the desires of all, whose odours are the odours of all, whose tastes are the tastes of all, who is everywhere, who has no sense organs, and who is free from desires—he is my Self and is in my heart. He is no other than Brahman . When I leave this body, I shall attain him. He who firmly believes this has no doubt in his mind. He will surely attain Brahman. This is what Śāṇḍilya has said.
There is a chest which has the mid-region as its inside and the earth as its bottom. It never decays. The quarters are its sides and the heaven its opening above. This chest is the container of treasures, for in it rests the whole universe.
The eastern quarter of the chest is called juhū , the southern quarter is called sahamānā , the western quarter is called rājñī , and the northern quarter is called subhūtā . Vāyu air is the son of these quarters. He who knows this, that Vāyu is the child of the quarters, does not have to weep over the loss of his child. ‘I know that Vāyu is the child of the quarters. May I never have to weep over the loss of my child.’
For the sake of my child’s life, I take refuge in that immortal kośa i.e., the chest, representing the universe. For the sake of my child’s life, I take refuge in prāṇa the vital breath. For the sake of my child’s life, I take refuge in bhūh the earth. For the sake of my child’s life, I take refuge in bhuvaḥ the mid-region. For the sake of my child’s life, I take refuge in svaḥ heaven.
When I said, ‘I take refuge in prāṇa ,’ I meant that prāṇa is everything visible, whatever there is, and therefore I have taken refuge in everything.
Then, when I said, ‘I take refuge in bhūḥ,’ what I meant was that I take refuge in the earth, I take refuge in the mid-region, and I take refuge in heaven.
Then, when I said, ‘I take refuge in bhuvaḥ ,’ what I meant was that I take refuge in fire, I take refuge in air, and I take refuge in the sun.
Then, when I said, “I take refuge in svaḥ,” what I meant was that I take refuge in the Ṛg Veda , I take refuge in the Yajur Veda , and I take refuge in the Sāma Veda . It is this that I meant.
The human body is like a sacrifice, and the first twenty-four years are like the morning libation. The gāyatrī has twenty-four syllables, and the morning libation is accompanied by the gāyatrī. The Vasus reside in this morning libation. The Vasus are the vital breaths and the sense organs, for the word vasu means those who make others live and who live themselves.
If, within these first twenty-four years of his life, he has some ailment, he should then say: ‘O Prāṇas , O Vasus , please extend this first libation to the midday libation. As the sacrifice, may I not disappear among the Vasus, who are my prāṇas i.e., who are like my life.’ If he prays like this, he gets rid of his ailment and becomes fully well.
Then the next forty-four years are like the midday libation. The triṣṭubh metre has forty-four syllables, and the midday libation is accompanied by a hymn which is in the triṣṭubh metre. The Rudras are connected with this midday libation. The prāṇas are called Rudras because they are cruel and make everyone in this world weep.
If, within these next forty-four years of his life, he has some ailment, he should then say: ‘O Prāṇas , O Rudras , please extend my midday libation and join it to the third libation. As the sacrifice, may I not disappear among the Rudras, who are my prāṇas i.e., who are like my life.’ If he prays like this, he gets rid of his ailment and becomes fully well.
Then the next forty-eight years are the third libation. The jagatī metre has forty-eight syllables, and the third libation is accompanied by a hymn which is in the jagatī metre. The Ādityas are connected with this third libation. The prāṇas are called Ādityas because they accept ādā all things.
If, within the next forty-eight years of his life, he has some ailment, he should then say: ‘O Prāṇas , O Ādityas , please extend my evening libation to the end of my life. As the sacrifice, may I not disappear among the Ādityas, who are my prāṇas i.e., who are like my life.’ If he prays like this, he gets rid of his ailment and becomes well.
Having known this, Itarā’s son Mahidāsa said: ‘O disease, why are you troubling me so? Rest assured, I am not going to die of this disease.’ He lived for one hundred and sixteen years. A person who knows this also lives that long.
That he has the desire to eat, the desire to drink, and no desire to indulge in sense pleasures—this is his initiation i.e., this is how he has to begin practising self-restraint.
After this he will eat, he will drink, or he will enjoy pleasure, as if he is observing upasad when he can only take milk or water.
After this, he laughs, he eats, and he even enjoys some sense pleasure—these represent the sounds coming from the stutas and śastras .
Next, austerity, charity, straightforwardness, nonviolence, and truthfulness—these are his dakṣiṇā .
Therefore people say, ‘He will give birth,’ or ‘He has given birth.’ In either case, it is a rebirth in the sense that when he starts living his life as a sacrifice, that is his rebirth. When death overtakes him, that is the conclusion of the sacrifice.
The sage Ghora , of the family of Aṅgirasa , taught this truth to Kṛṣṇa , the son of Devakī . As a result, Kṛṣṇa became free from all desires. Then Ghora said: ‘At the time of death a person should repeat these three mantras : “You never decay, you never change, and you are the essence of life.”’ Here are two Ṛk mantras in this connection:
7-8. Those who know Brahman see that the light shining in Para-Brahman is the seed of the world. This light is all-pervasive like daylight. It is eternal. It is that great light which is the cause of the world.
The mind is Brahman —this worship is called adhyātma . Next is that called adhidaivata : Space is Brahman. That is, meditate on space as Brahman. These two ways of meditation are advised: adhyātma and adhidaivata.
Brahman as the mind has four feet or, quarters. The organ of speech is one foot; prāṇa is the next foot; the eyes are the third foot; and the ears are the fourth foot. This is the adhyātma the physical and mental aspect of Brahman. Next is the adhidaivata aspect. Fire is one foot; air is another foot; the sun is the next foot; and the quarters are the fourth foot. These two ways of meditation are advised: adhyātma and adhidaivata.
Vāk is one of the four feet of Brahman as the mind. It shines in the light of fire and also radiates heat. He who knows this shines and radiates warmth with his good work, with his fame, and with the radiance he acquires from leading a scholarly and disciplined life.
Prāṇa the organ of smelling is one of the four feet of Brahman as the mind. It shines by the light of vāyu air and also radiates heat. He who knows this shines and radiates warmth with his good work, with his fame, and with the radiance he acquires from leading a scholarly and disciplined life.
The organ of vision is one of the four feet of Brahman as the mind. It shines by the light of the sun and also radiates heat. He who knows this shines and radiates warmth with his good work, with his fame, and with the radiance he acquires from leading a scholarly and disciplined life.
The organ of hearing is one of the four feet of Brahman as the mind. It shines by the light of the quarters and also radiates heat. He who knows this shines and radiates warmth with his good work, with his fame, and with the radiance he acquires from leading a scholarly and disciplined life.
It has been said, ‘ Āditya is Brahman .’ Now this is being explained: This universe was at first non-existent, being without names and forms. It was not visible, but it existed in a subtle form. Slowly it manifested itself, as a shoot comes out of a seed. Next it developed into an egg and remained for a whole year like that. It then split in two, one half becoming silver and the other half becoming gold.
Of these two parts of the egg, the one that is silver is this earth, and the one that is gold is heaven. The thick membranes are the mountains. The thin membranes are the clouds and mist. The veins are the rivers, and the fluid in the bladder is the ocean.
Then that which was born was the sun. Its appearance was greeted by joyous sounds from all beings, and many desirable things appeared. Since then, the sunrise and the sunset are both marked by joyous sounds from all beings, and many enjoyable things also appear at that time.
One who knows the sun as Brahman and worships it as such very soon hears sounds pleasing to the ears and also has many good things to enjoy.
In ancient times there was a king who was the great-grandson of Janaśruta. He was a highly charitable person, who gave many gifts in charity, and always with due respect. He also had large quantities of food cooked for people. With the thought in mind, ‘People all over will eat my food,’ he had many rest-houses built in different places.
Once he saw some swans flying overhead at night. The swan flying behind called out to the one ahead: ‘Hey, you short-sided one! Don’t you see that the brightness of Jānaśruti has spread all over the sky like daylight? Beware you don’t touch it. See that it doesn’t bum you’.
The swan in front replied: ‘Say, who is this person? From the way you are talking one would think he was Raikva with the cart.’ Then the other swan asked, ‘And who is this Raikva with the cart you are referring to?’.
‘Just as in a game of dice, when a person wins the toss called kṛta he automatically wins the lower tosses also, in the same way, whatever good work people do goes to the credit of Raikva. If anyone knows what Raikva knows, he becomes like Raikva. This is how I would describe Raikva.’
5-6. Jānaśruti Pautrāyaṇa overheard what the swan said. He got up from his bed and the first thing he did was to ask his attendant who was standing nearby: ‘O my child, can I be compared to Raikva with the cart? Who is this Raikva with the cart? What sort of person is he?’ Then he quoted what the swan had said: ‘Just as in a game of dice, if a person wins the toss called kṛta , he automatically wins the lower tosses also, in the same way, whatever good work people do goes to the credit of Raikva. If anyone knows what Raikva knows, he becomes like Raikva. This is how I would describe Raikva.’
Jānaśruti asked his attendant to go and look for Raikva. Having looked for him, the attendant thought, ‘I can’t find him,’ and returned to his master. Jānaśruti then said to him: ‘Well, why don’t you go to places where brāhmins are to be found—in forests and solitary places? Look for him there’.
The attendant noticed a man sitting under a cart, scratching a rash on his body. Sitting down close to him, the attendant asked, ‘Sir, are you Raikva with the cart?’ The man answered, ‘Well, yes, I am.’ The attendant thought, ‘I have found him,’ and returned.
Then Jānaśruti Pautrāyaṇa went to that place, taking with him six hundred cows, a gold necklace, and a chariot drawn by mules. He said to him Raikva:
‘O Raikva, all these—six hundred cows, a gold necklace, and a chariot drawn by mules—are for you. Please tell me about the god you worship’.
Raikva said to him, ‘You śūdra , the necklace and chariot along with the cows—let all these be yours.’ Jānaśruti left and then again came back—this time with one thousand cows, a gold necklace, a chariot drawn by mules, and his own daughter.
He said to Raikva: ‘I am giving you these thousand cows, this gold necklace, this chariot drawn by mules, this daughter of mine to be your wife, and also this village in which you live. Now, sir, please teach me’.
Lifting the face of the princess, Raikva said: ‘You have brought me many things but they are not making me speak. It is this face that is making me speak.’ The villages in the Mahāvṛṣa province, where Raikva lived, were known thenceforth as Raikvaparṇā. It was here Raikva taught Jānaśruti. Raikva said to him:
The air swallows everything. When fire is extinguished, it disappears into the air. When the sun sets, it disappears into the air. And when the moon sets, it disappears into the air.
When water dries up, it disappears into the air. The air swallows all these. This is the worship of the forces of nature ( adhidaivata ).
Next is the worship concerning the body. Prāṇa swallows everything. When a person sleeps, speech, the eyes, the ears, and the mind—all these go into prana . Prāṇa swallows all these.
These two swallow everything: air among the gods and prāṇa among the organs.
Once Śaunaka , the son of Kapi , and Abhipratārin, the son of Kakṣasena, were being served their meals when a brahmacārin appeared and begged for some food. They, however, refused to give him any.
The brahmacārin said: ‘One god has swallowed four sages. Who is he who protects this world? O Kāpeya , O Abhipratārin, that god exists in many forms, but human beings cannot see him. The food is meant for him, but you are not giving it to him’.
After thinking this over, Śaunaka Kāpeya went to the brahmacārin and said, ‘He who is the self of all the gods and goddesses, the creator of all things moveable and immoveable, who eats with his golden i.e., firm teeth, who is intelligent, whom others cannot eat, who eats things which are not food, whose greatness wise people think highly of—O brahmacārin, we worship him.’ After this he said, ‘Give this man alms’.
Then they gave him alms. The first five Vāyu , etc. and the second five prāṇa , etc. together make ten. That is kṛta the throw of dice of the highest denomination. These ten are the ten directions, and they are the food. This kṛta is Virāṭ . As Virāṭ is all-pervasive, everything is its food. By that Virāṭ all this is seen. He who knows this Virāṭ becomes Virāṭ himself. He becomes all-pervasive and everything becomes his food.
Once Satyakāma Jābāla said to his mother Jabālā: ‘Revered mother, I would like to live with a teacher as a celibate student. What is my lineage?’.
Jabālā said to him: ‘My son, I don’t know what your lineage is. I was very busy serving many people when I was young, and I had you. As this was the situation, I know nothing about your lineage. My name is Jabālā, and your name is Satyakāma. When asked about your lineage, say, “I am Satyakāma Jābāla .”’.
Satyakāma went to Gautama , the son of Haridrumata, and said: ‘Revered sir, I wish to live with you as a celibate. I have come, revered sir, to be your disciple’.
Gautama asked him, ‘O Somya, what is your lineage?’ Satyakāma said: ‘Sir, I do not know what my lineage is. When I asked my mother, she said to me: “I was very busy serving many people when I was young, and I had you. As this was the situation, I know nothing about your lineage. My name is Jabālā, and your name is Satyakāma.” So, sir, I am Satyakāma Jābāla ’.
Gautama said to him: ‘No non-brāhmin could speak like this. Therefore, you must be a brāhmin. O Somya, go and get me some fuel for the sacrificial fire. I will initiate you as a brāhmin by presenting you with the sacred thread, as you have not deviated from truth.’ After the initiation, he selected four hundred feeble and famished cows. Addressing Satyakāma, Gautama said, ‘O Somya, take these cows away and look after them.’ As. Satyakāma was taking them away, he said, ‘I will not come back until there are a thousand of them.’ He lived away for many years until they had become a thousand.
Then a bull called to Satyakāma, saying, ‘O Satyakāma!’ He replied, ‘Yes, lord.’ The bull then said: ‘We are now a thousand. Take us to the teacher’s house’.
The bull said, ‘Let me also tell you about one foot of Brahman .’ Satyakāma replied,’Yes, lord, please tell me.’ Then the bull said to him: ‘The east is one part of Brahman, the west is another, the south is another, and the north is yet another. O Somya, this is one foot of Brahman, consisting of four parts. This foot is called Prakāśavān, the shining’.
‘He who knows this foot of Brahman , which has four parts and is called “the Shining,” and worships it as such becomes famous in this world. He who knows this foot of Brahman, which has four parts and is called “the Shining,” and worships it as such attains other worlds which are luminous’.
Then the bull said, ‘ Agni fire will tell you about another foot of Brahman .’ The next day Satyakāma collected the cows and drove them towards his teacher’s house. At dusk they arrived at a place where they halted for the night. Having confined the cows and collected some fuel, he lit a fire and sat down just behind it facing east.
Fire called to him, ‘O Satyakāma.’ He replied, ‘Yes, lord’.
Fire said, ‘O Somya, let me tell you about one foot of Brahman .’ Satyakāma replied, ‘Yes, lord, please tell me.’ Fire said to him: ‘The earth is one part, the mid-region is another part, heaven is a third part, and the ocean is a fourth part. O Somya, these are the four parts that make up a foot of Brahman. This foot is named Anantavān, the Unlimited’.
‘He who knows this foot of Brahman , which has four parts and is known as “the Unlimited,” and worships it as such becomes long-lived in this world. He who knows this foot of Brahman, which has four parts and is known as “the Unlimited,” and worships it as such attains worlds which are long-lasting’.
Then the fire said, ‘The swan will tell you about another foot of Brahman .’ The next day Satyakāma collected the cows and drove them towards his teacher’s house. At dusk they arrived at a place where they halted for the night. Having confined the cows and collected some fuel, he lit a fire and sat down just behind it facing east.
The swan came flying to him and said, ‘O Satyakāma.’ Satyakāma replied, ‘Yes, lord’.
The swan said, ‘O Somya, let me tell you about one foot of Brahman .’ Satyakāma replied, ‘Yes, lord, please tell me.’ The swan said to him: ‘Fire is one part, the sun is another part, the moon is a third part, and lightning is a fourth part. O Somya, these are the four parts that make up a foot of Brahman. This foot is named Jyotiṣmān , the Luminous’.
‘He who knows this foot of Brahman , which has four parts and is known as “the Luminous,” and worships it as such becomes illustrious in this world. He who knows this foot of Brahman, which has four parts and is known as “the Luminous,” and worships it as such attains worlds which are luminous.
Then the swan said, ‘The madgu will tell you about another foot of Brahman .’ The next day Satyakāma collected the cows and drove them towards his teacher’s house. At dusk they arrived at a place where they halted for the night. Having confined the cows and collected some fuel, he lit a fire and sat down just behind it facing east.
The madgu came flying to him and said, ‘O Satyakāma.’ Satyakāma replied, ‘Yes, lord’.
The madgu said, ‘O Somya, let me tell you about one foot of Brahman .’ Satyakāma replied, ‘Yes, lord, please tell me.’ The madgu said to him: ‘ Prāṇa is one part, the eyes are another part, the ears are a third part, and the mind is a fourth part. O Somya, these are the four parts that make up a foot of Brahman. This foot is named Āyatanavān, the Support’.
‘He who knows this foot of Brahman , which has four parts and is known as “the Support,” and worships it as such becomes a support to others in this world. He who knows this foot of Brahman, which has four parts and is known as “the Support,” and worships it as such attains worlds which are spacious’.
In due course, Satyakāma reached his teacher’s house. The teacher greeted him, saying, ‘O Satyakāma.’ He replied, ‘Yes, lord’.
The teacher said: ‘Somya, you shine like one who has known Brahman . Who taught you?’ Satyakāma assured him: ‘Certainly no human being. But will you, O Lord, please teach me now about Brahman, the subject closest to my heart?’.
Satyakāma said, ‘I have heard from revered ones like you that a person learns best when he learns from a competent teacher.’ The teacher then, taught Satyakāma everything. Nothing was left out.
Upakosala Kāmalāyana lived twelve years with Satyakāma Jābāla as a celibate disciple, studying the scriptures and looking after his teacher’s sacrificial fires. On the completion of that period, other students were permitted to go home. The only exception was Upakosala. He was detained.
Satyakāma’s wife said to him: ‘The brahmacārin is much reduced by austerities and has looked after the fires with great care. Lest the fires blame you, I suggest you teach him.’ But Satyakāma did not teach him. Instead, he left on a journey.
Upakosala was upset and started fasting. His teacher’s wife said to him: ‘ Brahmacārin , eat something. Why are you not eating?’ Upakosala said: ‘There are too many desires in me and they are pulling me in different directions. I am like one suffering from many ailments. I don’t want to eat’.
Then the fires—the Dakṣiṇāgni , the Gārhapatya , and the Āhavanīya —began to say to each other: ‘This brahmacārin has become thin from practising austerities. He has so long looked after us with great care. Let us teach him.’ They said to Upakosala, ‘ Prāṇa is Brahman , ka happiness is Brahman, and kha space is Brahman.’
Upakosala said: ‘I know that prāṇa is Brahman . But that ka and kha are Brahman I do not know.’ The fires replied, ‘That which is ka is also kha , and that which is kha is also ka .’ Then the fires taught him that Brahman was both prāṇa and ākāśa space.
Then the Gārhapatya fire said to him Upakosala: ‘The earth, fire, food, and the sun—these are all part of my i.e., part of Brahman ’s body. The person seen in the solar orb is me. I am that’.
‘He who knows this Gārhapatya fire and worships it thus has all his sins removed, and he attains the world of the Gārhapatya fire. He lives a long and bright life, and his descendants do not perish. In this world and the next, we look after that person who knows this fire and worships it thus’.
Next the Dakṣiṇāgni Southern fire said to Upakosala: ‘Water, the quarters, the stars, and the moon—these are all part of my i.e., part of Brahman ’s body. The person seen in the moon is me. I am that’.
‘He who knows this Dakṣiṇāgni fire and worships it thus has all his sins removed, and he attains the world of the Dakṣiṇāgni fire. He lives a long and bright life, and his descendants do not perish. In this world and the next, we look after that person who knows this fire and worships it thus’.
Next the Āhavanīya fire said to Upakosala: ‘ Prāṇa , space, heaven, and lightning—these are all part of my i.e., part of Brahman ’s body. The person seen in lightning is me. I am that’.
‘He who knows this Āhavanīya fire and worships it thus has all his sins removed, and he attains the world of the Āhavanīya fire. He lives a long and bright life, and his descendants do not perish. In this world and the next, we look after that person who knows this fire and worships it thus’.
The fires said: ‘O Somya Upakosala, we have just told you the knowledge of fire. That is also Self-knowledge. Your teacher will tell you about the way to the next world.’ In due course, his teacher returned, and he called him, saying, ‘Upakosala’.
Upakosala replied, ‘Yes, lord.’ His teacher said: ‘O Somya, your face is shining like that of a knower of Brahman . Who has taught you?’ ‘Sir, who will teach me?’ He said this as if he was trying to hide the truth. Then, pointing to the fires, he said: ‘Earlier they looked, different. Now they look like this.’ In this way, he indicated the fires. The teacher asked, ‘Somya, what did the fires teach you?’.
Upakosala replied, ‘This is what they said.’ And he told his teacher all that the fires had taught him. The teacher said: ‘O Somya, they taught you only about the worlds, but I will teach you about Brahman .
The teacher said: ‘The person seen in the eyes is the Self. It is immortal and fearless. It is Brahman . This is why, if anyone puts clarified butter or water in the eyes, it goes to the corners of the eyes’.
They call him Saṃyadvāma , for everything that is good and beautiful comes to him. One who knows this has everything that is good and beautiful come to him.
This person in the eyes is Vāmanī , the source of all that is good and pure, for he inspires in people all that is good and pure. One who knows this grants all that is good and pure to others.
The person in the eyes is Bhāmanī , shining, for he shines in all the worlds including the sun. One who knows this shines in all the worlds.
Then, for those who know this, whether proper funeral rites are performed or not, they go after death to the world of light. From the world of light they go to the world of day; from the world of day to the world of the bright fortnight; from the world of the bright fortnight to the six months when the sun moves northward; from there they go to the year; from the year to the sun; from the sun to the moon; and from the moon to lightning. There someone, not human, receives them and leads them to brahmaloka . This is the way of the gods. This is also the way to Brahman . Those who go by this path never return to this mortal world. They never return.
He who blows i.e., air is the sacrifice. While moving, he purifies all this. Since he purifies all this while moving, he is the sacrifice. The mind and speech are both his paths.
2-3. The priest called brahmā in a sacrifice purifies one of these two paths i.e., the path of the mind by his discriminating mind. The hotā , the adhvaryu , and the udgātā priests purify the other i.e., the path of speech by chaste and elegant speech. If, however, the brahmā priest breaks his silence when the morning anuvāka has begun, before the paridhānīya Ṛk hymn has been read, then only one path the path of speech has been purified. The other is ruined. Just as a one-legged person trying to walk, or a one-wheeled chariot trying to move, is doomed, in the same way the sacrifice is ruined. And when the sacrifice is ruined, the sacrificer is also ruined. In fact, the sacrificer is even liable for having committed a sin by performing the sacrifice in that way.
But in the case of the sacrifice in which the reading of the morning anuvāka has already begun, and the brahmā priest does not break his silence before the paridhānīya has started, then both paths are purified. Neither of them becomes destroyed.
Just as a person with two legs can walk, or a chariot with two wheels can move, and attain the goal, so also his sacrifice succeeds. And if the sacrifice succeeds, the sacrificer also succeeds. He attains much greatness through his sacrifice.
Prajāpati worshipped the worlds, and from those which he worshipped he was able to extract their essence. From earth he took fire, from the interspace he took air, and from heaven he took the sun.
Then he worshipped these three deities. From those which he worshipped he extracted the essence. He got the Ṛk mantras from fire, the Yajuḥ mantras from air, and the Sāma mantras from the sun.
Then Prajāpati worshipped these three Vedas . And from those Vedas that were worshipped he extracted the essence. From the Ṛg Veda he got ‘bhūḥ,’ from the Yajur Veda he got ‘bhuvaḥ,’ and from the Sāma Veda he got ‘svaḥ’.
This is why, if it seems likely that there will be any harm done to the sacrifice because of a mistake in the Ṛk, the priest should offer oblations in the Gārhapatya fire saying, ‘Bhūḥ svāhā .’ Then, by the essence and strength of the Ṛk, any likely harm done to the sacrifice from a mistake in the Ṛk will be averted.
Then if it seems likely that there will be any harm done to the sacrifice because of a mistake in the Yajuḥ , the priest should offer oblations in the Dakṣiṇāgni fire saying, ‘ Bhuvaḥ svāhā .’ Then, by the essence and strength of the Yajuḥ, any likely harm done to the sacrifice from a mistake in the Yajuḥ will be averted.
Then if it seems likely that there will be any harm done to the sacrifice because of a mistake in the Sāma , the priest should offer oblations in the Āhavanīya fire saying, ‘svaḥ svāhā .’ Then, by the essence and strength of the Sāma, any likely harm done to the sacrifice from a mistake in the Sāma will be averted.
It is like joining gold with the help of borax, silver with the help of gold, tin with the help of silver, lead with the help of tin, iron with the help of lead, wood with the help of iron, and wood with the help of leather.
Similarly, by the power of these worlds, these deities, and these three holy scriptures, any flaws in the sacrifice are made up. Where there is a knowledgeable brahmā priest, that sacrifice gets the right medicine.
That sacrifice which is directed by a capable brahmā priest leads to the uttarāyaṇa the path of the gods. There is a verse in praise of such a learned priest: ‘Wherever the sacrifice goes wrong, this priest goes there to set things right’.
A good brahmā priest is one who is able to observe silence, or one who is thoughtful. Just as a horse protects the soldiers, a learned brahmā priest protects the sacrifice, the sacrifices, and all the other priests. Therefore, one should appoint only such a learned brahmā for one’s sacrifice. One should not appoint anyone else.
Om. He who knows the oldest and the best himself becomes the oldest and the best. It is prāṇa which is the oldest and the best.
He who knows that which is of high standing himself becomes of high standing among his own relatives. Eloquence gives one this high standing in society.
He who knows the support attains a support in this world and also in the other world i.e., heaven. The eye is indeed the support.
He who knows affluence has all things desired by human beings and gods come to him. Affluence is represented by the ears.
He who knows the abode becomes the shelter of his family. The mind is the abode.
Once the sense organs began to quarrel among themselves, each one claiming it was supreme. They each said, ‘I am the best. I am the best’.
The organs then went to their father Prajāpati and said, ‘Revered sir, who among us is the best?’ He replied, ‘He is the best among you on whose departure the body becomes totally untouchable’.
First speech left the body. After staying away one whole year, he came back and asked the other organs, ‘How did you sustain yourselves in my absence?’ The rest of the organs said: ‘Just as mute people do without speaking, but they are able to survive by breathing, and see with the eyes, hear with the ears, and think with the mind. We did the same.’ Hearing all this, speech re-entered the body.
Next the organ of vision left the body. After staying away one whole year, it came back and asked the other organs, ‘How did you sustain yourselves in my absence?’ The rest of the organs said: ‘Just as blind people do without seeing, but they are able to survive by breathing, and speak with the organ of speech, hear with the ears, and think with the mind. We did the same.’ Hearing all this, the organ of vision re-entered the. body.
Next the organ of hearing left the body. After staying away one whole year, it came back and asked the other organs, ‘How did you sustain yourselves in my absence?’ The rest of the organs said: ‘Just as deaf people do without hearing, but they are able to survive by breathing, and speak with the organ of speech, see with the eyes, and think with the mind. We did the same.’ Hearing all this, the organ of hearing re-entered the body.
Next the mind left the body. After staying away one whole year, he came back and asked the other organs, ‘How did you sustain yourselves in my absence?’ The rest of the organs said: ‘Just as children do without thinking for themselves, but they are able to survive by breathing, and speak with the organ of speech, see with the eyes, and hear with the ears. We did the same.’ Hearing all this, the mind re-entered the body.
Now prāṇa , the vital force, decided to leave. Just as a good horse is able to uproot the pegs to which its feet are tied, similarly, the chief prāṇa was about to carry the other organs away with him. Those other organs then came to him and with great humility said: ‘O lord, be our leader. You are the greatest among us. Please don’t leave us’.
The organ of speech then said to the chief prāṇa , ‘If I have the quality of high standing, it is because you have that quality.’ Next the organ of vision said to him, ‘True, I have the quality of supporting others, but I owe that quality to you’.
The organ of hearing then said to the chief prāṇa , ‘If I have the quality of affluence, it is because you have that quality.’ Next the mind said to him, ‘True, I have the quality of being a shelter to many, but that quality is, in fact, yours’.
Scholars do not call them organs of speech, eyes, ears, or minds. They call them ‘ prāṇas ,’ for prāṇa has become all these organs.
Prāṇa then asked, ‘What will be my food?’ The other organs said: ‘Anything that even dogs, birds, and other animals can eat in this world is your food.’ All that is food for ana. Ana is a name of prāṇa. For one who knows this nothing is uneatable. That is, he can eat any food that an animal can eat.
Prāṇa asked, ‘What will be my covering?’ The organs replied, ‘Water.’ This is why, before and after eating their meals, people cover him with water i.e., they sip water. He then becomes covered with a cloth and is no longer naked.
Having told this to Vyāghrapada’s son Gośruti , Satyakāma Jābāla said, ‘If a person tells this even to a dry stump of a tree, branches and leaves will grow off it’.
Then if anyone wishes to attain greatness, he should first become initiated on a new moon day, and after that, on the night of a full moon, he should prepare a paste of various herbs and mix them together with curd and honey. He should then offer this oblation to the fire saying, ‘Jyeṣṭhāya śreṣṭhāya svāhā ,’ i.e., Svāhā to the oldest and to the best. Whatever is left over in the offering spoon he should put into the homa pot.
Saying, ‘Vasiṣṭhāya svāhā ’ i.e., svāhā to high standing, one should offer the oblation to the fire and then put whatever is left over in the offering spoon into the homa pot. Saying, ‘Pratiṣṭhāyai svāhā’ i.e., svāhā to the support, one should offer the oblation to the fire and then put whatever is left over in the offering spoon into the homa pot. Saying, ‘Sampade svāhā’ i.e., svāhā to affluence, one should offer the oblation to the fire and then put whatever is left over in the offering spoon into the homa pot. Saying, ‘Āyatanāya svāhā’ i.e., svāhā to the abode, one should offer the oblation to the fire and then put whatever is left over in the offering spoon into the homa pot.
Then, moving some distance from the fire and holding the homa pot in his hands, he keeps repeating the mantra : ‘You are named ama , because all this rests on you. You are the first, the best, outstanding, and supreme. May I also be the first, the best, outstanding, and supreme. May I be all all this.’
Then, while saying this Ṛk mantra foot by foot, he eats some of what is in the homa pot. He says, ‘We pray for that food of the shining deity,’ and then eats a little of what is in the homa pot. Saying, ‘We eat the food of that deity,’ he eats a little of what is in the homa pot. Saying, ‘It is the best and the support of all,’ he eats a little of what is in the homa pot. Saying, ‘We quickly meditate on Bhaga ,’ he eats the rest and washes the vessel or spoon. Then, with his speech and mind under control, he lies down behind the fire, either on the skin of an animal or directly on the sacrificial ground. If he sees a woman in his dream, he knows that the rite has been successful and that he will succeed in whatever he does.
Here is a verse in this connection: When one sees a woman in a dream while performing a rite for the fulfillment of a desire, that means it is successful. One can know this from the dream.
Once Śvetaketu , the grandson of Aruṇa , went to the court of the Pañcālas . Pravāhaṇa, the son of Jīvala, asked him, ‘Young man, did your father teach you?’ Śvetaketu replied: ‘Yes, revered sir, he did’.
Pravāhaṇa asked, ‘Do you have any idea where, from this world, human beings go in heaven?’ ‘No, sir, I have no idea,’ replied Śvetaketu . ‘Do you know how they come back?’ ‘No, sir, I don’t.’ ‘Have you any idea where the two paths—the path of the gods and the path of the ancestors—part?’ ‘No, sir, I don’t know’.
Pravāhaṇa asked, ‘Do you know why the other world the world of the moon is not filled with people?’ Śvetaketu replied, ‘No, revered sir, I don’t know.’ ‘Do you know why after the fifth oblation water comes to be called “ puruṣa ” man?’ ‘No, sir, I don’t know’.
Pravāhaṇa said: ‘Why did you say then, “I have been taught”? How can one who does not know these things say, “I have been taught”?’ Śvetaketu was hurt. He went back to his father and said, ‘You have not really taught ṃe, yet you said, “I have taught you.”’.
Śvetaketu said: ‘That friend of the princes put five questions to me. I was not able to answer a single one of them.’ He then told his father the five questions. After pondering over them for some time, his father said: ‘Those questions you told me about on your return from the court—I am not able to answer even one of them. If I knew the answers, why should I have not told you?’.
Gautama then went to the king’s palace. On his arrival, the king welcomed him respectfully. The next morning, when the king was in his court, Gautama went there to meet him. The king said to him, ‘Revered Gautama, ask for a boon from me—anything a person might wish for.’ Gautama replied: ‘Let those things be with you. Please tell me whatever you said to my son.’ Hearing this, the king turned pale.
The king then issued orders that Gautama should stay with him for a long time as a brahmacari . Gautama did that. One day the king said to him: ‘O Gautama, regarding the matter which you asked about, no brāhmin before you had access to this knowledge. This is why in the past, in all the worlds, it was only the kṣatriyas who had the right to impart this knowledge.’ Having said this, he proceeded to teach Gautama.
O Gautama , heaven is the sacrificial fire; the sun is its fuel; the rays are the smoke; day is the flame; the moon is the embers; and the stars are the sparks.
The gods i.e., the organs of the sacrificer offer water as a token of respect to the fire heaven. Out of that oblation appears King Soma the shining moon.
O Gautama , the god of rain is the sacrificial fire; air is its fuel; the cloud is the smoke; lightning is the flame; the thunderbolt is the embers; and thunder is the sparks.
The gods offer King Soma the shining moon as the oblation to the fire. Out of that oblation appears rain.
O Gautama , the earth is the sacrificial fire; the year is its fuel; the sky is the smoke; night is the flame; the quarters are the embers; and the intermediate directions are the sparks.
The gods offer rain as the oblation to the fire. Out of that oblation appears food.
O Gautama , man is the sacrificial fire; speech is his fuel; prāṇa is the smoke; the tongue is the flame; the eyes are the embers; and the ears are the sparks.
The gods offer food as the oblation to the fire. Out of that oblation appears semen.
1-2. O Gautama , woman is the sacrificial fire... The gods offer semen as the oblation to the fire. Out of that oblation appears the foetus.
Thus, after the fifth oblation, water becomes known as ‘man.’ The foetus lies within the mother’s womb, covered with membrane, for about nine or ten months, and then it is born.
When a person is born, he lives as long as he is destined to live. Then, when he dies as ordained, they his sons or disciples take him from his home to the fire from which he came. It is that same fire from which he was born and to which he owes his birth.
1-2. Those who know this about the five fires, and those who live in the forest practising austerities with faith—they go after death to the world of light. From the world of light they go to the world of day; from the world of day to the world of the bright fortnight; from the world of the bright fortnight to the six months when the sun moves northward; from there they go to the year; from the year to the sun; from the sun to the moon; and from the moon to lightning. There someone, not human, receives them and leads them to brahmaloka . This is the path of the gods.
On the other hand, those who live in the village and perform acts of public service, charity, and so on, attain the world of smoke. From there they go to the world of the night; from night they go to the world of the dark fortnight; and from the dark fortnight they go to the world of the six months when the sun moves to the south. This means that they never attain the world of the year.
From the six months of the southern solstice, they go to the world of the ancestors, and from there they go to the sky. Then from the sky they go to the moon. This is King Soma . This is the food of the gods. The gods enjoy eating this food.
Living in the world of the moon until the fruits of his work are exhausted, he then goes back to this world along the path he came. First going to the sky, he then goes to air. Having become air, he next becomes smoke. Having become smoke, he then becomes mist.
Having become mist, it changes into clouds. Then from clouds, it becomes rain and falls to the earth. Finally it grows as paddy, barley, plants, trees, sesame, beans, and so forth. The change from this state is very difficult. Those who eat these things produce children just like themselves.
Among them, those who did good work in this world in their past life attain a good birth accordingly. They are born as a brāhmin, a kṣatriya , or a vaiśya . But those who did bad work in this world in their past life attain a bad birth accordingly, being born as a dog, a pig, or as a casteless person.
But those who do not follow either of these two paths are born among small animals and insects again and again. This can be said about those who are born in this third state: ‘Be born and die.’ This is why the other world does not get filled up. Therefore one should despise this state. Here is a verse on the subject—
A person who steals gold, or drinks liquor, or goes to bed with his teacher’s wife, or kills a brāhmin—these four are lost. Also lost is the fifth—one who keeps company with such people.
But he who knows the five fires remains pure even if he is in the company of these people. He who knows this is pure and innocent, and after death he goes to a holy world.
Upamanyu ’s son, Prācīnaśāla; Puluṣa’s son, Satyayajña; Bhāllavi’s son, Indradyumna ; Śarkarākṣa’s son, Jana ; and Aśvatarāśva’s son, Buḍila—these eminent householders, who were Vedic scholars, once met to decide the issue: Who is our Self? And what is Brahman ?
They talked among themselves and decided what to do. One of them said: ‘Revered sirs, Uddālaka Āruṇi is the person who now knows about this Vaiśvānara Self. Let us go to him then.’ So they all went to him.
Uddālaka understood that they had come to ask him about the Vaiśvānara Ātman . He decided: ‘These eminent householders and Vedic scholars will ask me questions, and I may not be able to answer all of them. Therefore I will direct them to another teacher’.
Uddālaka told them: ‘Sirs, at the present time King Aśvapati , the son of Kekaya , alone knows about the Vaiśvānara Ātman . With your permission, we will go to him.’ They then left to see Aśvapati.
When they arrived, Aśvapati had each of his guests worshipped separately. The next morning, after getting up from bed, he said to them: ‘There is no thief in my state, no miserly person, no drunkard, no brāhmin who does not perform the agnihotra sacrifice, no one who is uneducated, no adulterer, and therefore no adulteress. Sirs, I am performing a sacrifice. The amount of money I will be giving to each priest in this sacrifice, I will give to each one of you. Revered sirs, please stay here’.
They said: ‘When a person visits someone, first and foremost, he states why he has come. At the present time, you are the one who knows about the Vaiśvānara Ātman . Please tell us about it’.
He said to them, ‘I will give you my answer tomorrow morning.’ The next day they went back to him in the forenoon with some fuel in their hands. Without initiating them, he said this—
The king said, ‘O son of Upamanyu , whom do you worship as the Vaiśvānara Self?’ The son of Upamanyu replied, ‘O King, I worship heaven.’ The king said: ‘The Self you worship is the Vaiśvānara Self which is Suteja —i.e., bright and beautiful. That is why whoever is born in your family is bright, brighter, and still brighter’.
‘You enjoy eating food and you see your dear ones and everything pleasant. He who worships the Vaiśvānara Self thus enjoys eating food and is able to see his dear ones. He also has children in his family who shine with the radiance of Brahman i.e., they become well known for their good conduct and scholarship. But heaven is like the head of the Self.’ Then the king said, ‘If you had not come to me your head would have fallen off’.
The king then said to Satyayajña Pauluṣi, ‘O Prācīnayogya, whom do you worship as the Self?’ Satyayajña replied, ‘I worship Āditya , the sun, revered king.’ The king said: ‘That which you worship as the Vaiśvānara Ātman is named Viśvarūpa . This is why you have in your family wealth in many forms’.
‘You now have chariots drawn by mules. You are served by maidservants, and you have a necklace. You enjoy eating food and you see your dear ones and everything pleasant. He who worships the Vaiśvānara Self thus enjoys eating food and is able to see his dear ones. He also has children in his family who shine with the radiance of Brahman i.e., they become well known for their good conduct and scholarship. But this Āditya is like the eye of the Self.’ Then the king said, ‘If you had not come to me you would have become blind’.
The king then said to Indradyumna Bhāllaveya, ‘O Vaiyāghrapadya , whom do you worship as the Self?’ Indradyumna replied, ‘I worship Vāyu air, revered king.’ The king said: ‘That which you worship as the Vaiśvānara Ātman is named Pṛthagvartmā one who changes direction. This is why you receive gifts from all directions. And this is also why different kinds of chariots follow you in rows’.
‘You enjoy eating food and you see your dear ones and everything pleasant. He who worships the Vaiśvānara Self thus enjoys eating food and is able to see his dear ones. He also has children in his family who shine with the radiance of Brahman i.e., they become well known for their good conduct and scholarship. But Vāyu air is like the life i.e., the vital force of the Self.’ Then the king said, ‘If you had not come to me your vital force would have left the body’.
The king then said to Jana , ‘O Sārkarākṣya, whom do you worship as the Self?’ Jana replied, ‘I worship Ākāśa space, revered king.’ The king said: ‘That which you worship as the Vaiśvānara Ātman is named Bahula pervasive. This is why you have so many children and so much wealth’.
‘You enjoy eating food and you see your dear ones and everything pleasant. He who worships the Vaiśvānara Self thus enjoys eating food and is able to see his dear ones. He also has children in his family who shine with the radiance of Brahman i.e., they become well known for their good conduct and scholarship. But Ākāśa space is like the mid part of the Self.’ Then the king said, ‘If you had not come to me the middle part of your body would have shrunk’.
The king then said to Buḍila Āśvatarāśvi, ‘O Vaiyāghrapadya , whom do you worship as the Self?’ Buḍila replied, ‘I worship water, revered king.’ The king said: ‘That which you worship as the Vaiśvānara Ātman is named Rayi wealth. This is why you are rich and healthy’.
‘You enjoy eating food and you see your dear ones and everything pleasant. He who worships the Vaiśvānara Self thus enjoys eating food and is able to see his dear ones. He also has children in his family who shine with the radiance of Brahman i.e., they become well known for their good conduct and scholarship. But water is like the bladder of the Self.’ Then the king said, ‘If you had not come to me your bladder would have burst’.
The king then said to Uddālaka Āruṇi , ‘O Gautama , whom do you worship as the Self?’ Uddālaka replied, ‘I worship the earth, revered king.’ The king said: ‘That which you worship as the Vaiśvānara Ātman is named Pratiṣṭhā the support. This is why you have so many children and animals to support you’.
‘You enjoy eating food and you see your dear ones and everything pleasant. He who worships the Vaiśvānara Self thus enjoys eating food and is able to see his dear ones. He also has children in his family who shine with the radiance of Brahman i.e., they become well known for their good conduct and scholarship. But the earth is like the feet of the Self.’ Then the king said, ‘If you had not come to me your feet would have become extremely weak’.
The king said to the brāhmins: ‘Those of you who are here meditate on the Vaiśvānara Self only in part. That is why when you eat you think you are eating separately. He who worships the Self as all-pervasive and infinite, enjoys eating through whoever eats in the worlds, through all beings, and through all selves.
Suteja i.e., ‘the bright and beautiful’—heaven is the head of this Vaiśvānara Self; Viśvarūpa ‘having many forms’—the sun is the eye; Pṛthagvartmā ‘one who changes direction’—air is the prāṇa ; Bahula ‘pervasive’—space is the middle part; Rayi ‘wealth’—water is the bladder; the earth Pratiṣṭhā —‘the support’ is the feet; the sacrificial altar is the chest; the kuśa grass is the hair on the chest; the Gārhapatya fire is the heart; the Anvāhāryapacana i.e., the Dakṣiṇāgni fire is the mind; and the Āhavanīya fire is the mouth.
The first part of the food is like the first oblation. One who eats should offer it as an oblation to prāṇa , saying, ‘Prāṇāya svāhā ’ i.e., I offer this as an oblation to prāṇa. With this, your prāṇa becomes pleased.
When prāṇa is pleased, the eye is pleased; when the eye is pleased, the sun is pleased; when the sun is pleased, heaven is pleased; when heaven is pleased, whatever there is ruled by heaven and the sun is pleased. Then when that is pleased, the eater derives pleasure from his children, from his animals, from an abundance of food, from physical strength, and from his good life and scholarship.
When he the eater offers the second oblation, he offers it saying, ‘Vyānāya svāhā ’ I offer this as an oblation to vyāna . With this, vyāna becomes pleased.
When vyāna is pleased, the ear is pleased; when the ear is pleased, the moon is pleased; when the moon is pleased, the quarters are pleased; with the quarters being pleased, whatever there is ruled by the quarters and the moon is pleased. Then when that is pleased, the eater derives pleasure from his children, from his animals, from an abundance of food, from physical strength, and from his good life and scholarship.
When he the eater offers the third oblation, he offers it saying, ‘Apānāya svāhā ’ I offer this as an oblation to apāna . With this, apāna becomes pleased.
When apāna is pleased, the organ of speech is pleased; the organ of speech being pleased, fire is pleased; when fire is pleased, the earth is pleased; the earth being pleased, whatever is under the control of the earth and fire is pleased. Then when that is pleased, the eater derives pleasure from his children, from his animals, from an abundance of food, from physical strength, and from his good -life and scholarship.
When he the eater offers the fourth oblation, he offers it saying, ‘Samānāya svāhā ’ I offer this as an oblation to samāna . With this, samāna becomes pleased.
When samāna is pleased, the mind is pleased; when the mind is pleased, the cloud is pleased; when the cloud is pleased, lightning is pleased; lightning being pleased, whatever is under the control of lightning and the cloud is pleased. Then when that is pleased, the eater derives pleasure from his children, from his animals, from an abundance of food, from physical strength, and from his good life and scholarship.
When he the eater offers the fifth oblation, he offers it saying, ‘Udānāya svāhā ’ I offer this as an oblation to udāna . With this, udāna becomes pleased.
When udāna is pleased, the organ of touch is pleased; the organ of touch being pleased, air is pleased; when air is pleased, space is pleased; when space is pleased, whatever is under the control of air and space is pleased. Then when that is pleased, the eater derives pleasure from his children, from his animals, from an abundance of food, from physical strength, and from his good life and scholarship.
If a person performs the Agnihotra sacrifice without knowing anything about the Vaiśvānara Self, it will be like offering oblations into ashes instead of the fire.
But he who performs the Agnihotra sacrifice with full knowledge of the Vaiśvānara Self is deemed to have offered oblations to all the worlds, to all beings, and to all selves.
Just as the cotton fibres of the iṣīkā grass are totally consumed when thrown into the fire, similarly all sins are consumed of one who performs the Agnihotra sacrifice with the knowledge of the Vaiśvānara Self.
Therefore, even if a person who knows the Vaiśvānara Ātman gives the remnants of his food after eating to a person who has no caste, that will be like his oblation offered to his own Vaiśvānara Self. Here is a verse on the subject:
Just as here in this world, when children are hungry they go to their mother and beg for food, in the same way, all living beings beg that the Agnihotra sacrifice may be performed without any delay.
Āruṇi had a son named Śvetaketu . Once Āruṇi told him: ‘Śvetaketu, you should now live as a brahmacārin . No one in our family has not studied the scriptures and has not been a good brāhmin’.
Śvetaketu went to his teacher’s house at the age of twelve. After studying all the Vedas , he returned home when he was twenty-four, having become very serious and vain, and thinking himself to be a great scholar. Noticing this, his father said to him: ‘O Śvetaketu, you have now become very serious and vain, and you think you are a great scholar. But did you ask your teacher for that teaching about Brahman —
‘—that teaching by which what is never heard becomes heard, what is never thought of becomes thought of, what is never known becomes known?’ Śvetaketu asked, ‘Sir, what is that teaching?’.
O Somya, it is like this: By knowing a single lump of earth you know all objects made of earth. All changes are mere words, in name only. But earth is the reality.
O Somya, it is like this: By knowing a single lump of gold you know all objects made of gold. All changes are mere words, in name only. But gold is the reality.
O Somya, it is like this: By knowing a single nail-cutter you know all objects made of iron. All changes are mere words, in name only. But iron is the reality. O Somya, this is the teaching I spoke of.
Śvetaketu said: ‘Surely my revered teachers did not know this truth. If they knew it, why should they not have told me? So please explain it to me, sir.’ His father said, ‘Let it be so, my son’.
Somya, before this world was manifest there was only existence, one without a second. On this subject, some maintain that before this world was manifest there was only non-existence, one without a second. Out of that non-existence, existence emerged.
The father said: ‘O Somya, what proof is there for this—that from nothing something has emerged? Rather, before this world came into being, O Somya, there was only existence, one without a second’.
That Existence decided: ‘I shall be many. I shall be born.’ He then created fire. That fire also decided: ‘I shall be many. I shall be born.’ Then fire produced water. That is why whenever or wherever a person mourns or perspires, he produces water.
That water decided: ‘I shall be many; I shall be born.’ That water then created food. This is why whenever and wherever there is rain, at once food grows in great abundance. It is from water that food is produced.
Living beings have their origin in three ways: from eggs, from parents, and from plants.
That god Existence decided: ‘Entering into these three deities fire, water, and earth, as the individual self, I shall manifest myself in many names and forms’.
Sat Existence thought, ‘I shall divide each of these three deities threefold.’ Then, having entered into these three deities as the individual self, he manifested himself as names and forms.
Having so decided, he made each of these three elements threefold. But as to how each of these three deities becomes threefold, O Somya, learn this from me.
The red colour of gross fire is from subtle fire, the white colour is from subtle water, and the dark colour is from subtle earth. Thus that which constitutes the ‘fire’-ness of fire is gone. All changes are mere words, in name only i.e., fire is only a name indicating a certain condition. The three colours are the reality.
The red colour of the sun is from fire, the white colour is from water, and the dark colour is from earth. Thus that which constitutes the ‘sun’-ness of the sun is gone. All changes are mere words, in name only. The three colours are the reality.
The red colour of the moon is from fire, the white colour is from water, and the dark colour is from earth. Thus that which constitutes the ‘moon’-ness of the moon is gone. All changes are mere words, in name only. The three colours are the reality.
The red colour of lightning is from fire, the white colour is from water, and the dark colour is from earth. Thus that which constitutes the ‘lightning’-ness of lightning is gone. All changes are mere words, in name only. The three colours are the reality.
The earlier great householders, who were well read in the Vedas , knew this. They said, ‘There is nothing anyone can mention that is not heard of or thought of or already known to us.’ I his is because they came to know about the three colours.
They knew that whatever else was seen as red was the colour of fire; whatever else was seen as white was the colour of water; and whatever else was seen as dark was the colour of earth.
And whatever else was not properly known they understood was the combination of those three deities fire, water, and earth. O Somya, now learn from me how these three deities enter into a person and become threefold.
When we eat food, it divides itself into three parts. The grossest part of it becomes excreta; that which is less gross becomes our flesh; and the finest part becomes our mind.
When we drink water, it becomes divided in three parts. The grossest part of it becomes urine; that which is less gross becomes blood; and the finest part becomes prāṇa , the vital force.
When we eat fire i.e., butter, oil, etc., it divides itself into three parts. The grossest part of it becomes bone; that which is less gross becomes marrow; and the subtlest part becomes speech.
‘O Somya, the mind is nourished by food, prāṇa by water, and speech by fire.’ Śvetaketu then said, ‘Sir, will you please explain this to me again?’ ‘Yes, Somya, I will explain again,’ replied his father.
When curd is churned, the finest part of it rises to the surface. That becomes butter.
O Somya, in the same way, the finest part of the food that is eaten rises to the surface and becomes the mind.
O Somya, the finest part of water that is drunk rises to the surface and becomes our prāṇa .
O Somya, the finest part of fire butter, etc. that is eaten rises to the surface and becomes our speech.
‘O Somya, the mind is certainly nourished by food, pṛāṇa by water, and speech by fire.’ Śvetaketu then said, ‘Sir, will you please explain this to me again?’ ‘Yes, I will explain again, O Somya,’ replied his father.
O Somya, a person has sixteen parts, and all your sixteen parts are intact. Do not eat anything for fifteen days, but drink as much water as you like. Life is dependent on water. If you do not drink water, you will lose your life.
Śvetaketu did not eat anything for fifteen days. After that he came to his father and said, ‘O Father, what shall I recite?’ His father said, ‘Recite the Ṛk, Yajuḥ , and Sāma mantras .’ Śvetaketu replied, ‘I can’t recall any of them, sir’.
The father said to Śvetaketu : ‘O Somya, from a blazing fire, if there is but a small piece of ember left, the size of a firefly, it cannot bum anything bigger than that. Similarly, O Somya, because only one small part of your sixteen parts remains, you cannot remember the Vedas . Eat something and then you will understand what I am saying’.
Śvetaketu ate something and then went to his father. Whatever his father asked him, he was able to follow.
The father said to him: ‘O Somya, from a blazing fire, if there is but a small piece of ember left, the size of a firefly, the fire can again blaze up when you add some grass. The fire, in fact, can then blaze up even more than it did before’.
‘In the same way, O Somya, of your sixteen parts, only one remained. But that, when nourished by food, has revived, and by that you are now able to follow the Vedas . O Somya, this is why I said that the mind was nourished by food, prāṇa was nourished by water, and speech was nourished by fire.’ Śvetaketu now understood what his father was saying.
Uddālaka Āruṇi said to his son Śvetaketu : ‘O Somya, let me explain to you the concept of deep sleep. When a person is said to be sleeping, O Somya, he becomes one with Sat Existence, and he attains his real Self. That is why people say about him, “He is sleeping.” He is then in his Self’.
Just as a bird tied to a rope flutters here and there, and when it cannot get any shelter anywhere, it surrenders itself to its bondage; in the same way, O Somya, the mind runs in every direction, and when it fails to get a resting place anywhere, it surrenders itself to prāṇa , the vital force. The mind, O Somya, is tied to prāṇa.
O Somya, now learn from me about hunger and thirst. When a person is said to be hungry, it is to be understood that the food he ate has been earned away by water. Just as people refer to a leader of cows, or a leader of horses, or a leader of people, similarly, people say that water is the leader of food. So also, O Somya, know that this sprout i.e., the body is the product of something i.e., of food and drink. It cannot be without a root.
Where else, except in food, can the body have its root? In the same way, O Somya, when food is the sprout, search for water as the root; when water is the sprout, O Somya, search for fire as the root; when fire is the sprout, O Somya, search for Sat Existence as the root. O Somya, Sat is the root, Sat is the abode, and Sat is the support of all these beings.
Then when a person is said to be thirsty, it is to be understood that the water he drank has been carried away by fire. Just as people refer to a leader of cows, or a leader of horses, or a leader of people, similarly, people say that fire is the leader of water. So also, O Somya, know that this sprout i.e., the body is the product of something i.e., of food and drink. It cannot be without a root.
Where else, except in water, can the body have its root? O Somya, when water is the sprout, search for fire as the root; when fire is the sprout, O Somya, search for Sat Existence as the root. O Somya, Sat is the root, Sat is the abode, and Sat is the support of all these beings. As to how, O Somya, these three deities fire, water, and earth enter a body and each becomes threefold, this has already been explained. O Somya, as this person is dying, his speech merges into the mind, his mind into prāṇa , his prāṇa into fire, and then fire merges into Brahman , the Supreme Deity.
‘That which is the subtlest of all is the Self of all this. It is the Truth. It is the Self. That thou art, O Śvetaketu .’ Śvetaketu then said, ‘Sir, please explain this to me again.’ ‘Yes, Somya, I will explain again,’ replied his father.
O Somya, as bees produce honey by collecting the juice from various trees and mixing them together to make one juice—
—O Somya, and just as those juices now are no longer conscious of their separate identities, thinking, ‘I am the juice from such-and-such tree,’ and ‘I am the juice from such-and-such tree’; similarly, when all these beings attain unity in the Self, they are not conscious of it. They do not think, ‘We were once separate, but now we are all one with the Self’.
Whatever they were before in this world—whether a tiger or lion or leopard or boar or bug or insect or flea or mosquito—they are born again. They never know that they came from Sat.
‘That which is the subtlest of all is the Self of all this. It is the Truth. It is the Self. That thou art, O Śvetaketu .’ Śvetaketu then said, ‘Sir, please explain this to me again.’ ‘Yes, Somya, I will explain it again,’ replied his father.
O Somya, those rivers belonging to the east run to the east, and those belonging to the west run to the west. Rising from the sea, they go back to it and become one with it. Just as, when they reach the sea, they do not know their separate identities—‘I am this river,’ or ‘I am that river’—
—In the same way, O Somya, all these beings, having come from Sat Brahman , never know this. They never think, ‘We have come from Sat.’ Whatever they were before in this world—whether a tiger or lion or leopard or boar or bug or insect or flea or mosquito—they are born again according to their karma . They never know that they came from Sat.
‘That which is the subtlest of all is the Self of all this. It is the Truth. It is the Self. That thou art, O Śvetaketu .’ Śvetaketu then said, ‘Sir, please explain this to me again.’ ‘Yes, Somya, I will explain it again,’ replied his father.
1-2. O Somya, if someone strikes at the root of a big tree, it will continue to live, though it may exude some juice. If he strikes at the middle, it will still live, though it may exude some juice. If he strikes at the top of the tree, it will survive, though it may exude some juice. Pervaded by the self, the tree will keep drinking juice and living happily. But if the self leaves a branch of a tree, that branch withers away and dies. If it leaves a second branch, that branch too will die. If it leaves a third branch, that branch also will die. If the self withdraws from the whole tree, then the whole tree will die.
The father said; ‘O Somya, know this: When the self leaves the body, the body surely dies. The self, however, never dies. That which is the subtlest of all is the Self of all this. It is the Truth. It is the Self. That thou art, O Śvetaketu .’ Śvetaketu then said, ‘Sir, please explain this to me again.’ ‘Yes, Somya, I will explain it again,’ replied his father.
Uddālaka said, ‘Bring me a fruit from this banyan tree.’ Śvetaketu replied, ‘I have brought it, sir.’ Uddālaka: ‘Break it.’ Śvetaketu: ‘I’ve broken it, sir.’ Uddālaka: ‘What do you see inside?’ Śvetaketu: ‘There are tiny seeds, sir.’ Uddālaka: ‘Break one of them, my son.’ Śvetaketu: ‘Sir, I’ve broken it.’ Uddālaka: ‘What do you see in it?’ Śvetaketu: ‘Nothing, sir’.
Uddālaka said: ‘O Somya, the finest part in that seed is not visible to you. But in that finest part lies hidden the huge banyan tree. Have faith in what I say, O Somya’.
‘That which is the subtlest of all is the Self of all this. It is the Truth. It is the Self. That thou art, O Śvetaketu .’ Śvetaketu then said, ‘Sir, please explain this to me again.’ ‘Yes, Somya, I will explain it again,’ replied his father.
1-2. Uddālaka said, ‘Put this lump of salt into water and come to me in the morning.’ Śvetaketu did as he was told. Uddālaka said to him, ‘My son, bring me the salt that you put in the water.’ Śvetaketu looked, but he could not find it, as the salt had dissolved in the water. Uddālaka said, ‘My son, drink the water at the surface.’ Śvetaketu did that, and Uddālaka asked, ‘How does it taste?’ Śvetaketu replied, ‘It is saline.’ Uddālaka then said: ‘Drink it from the middle. How does it taste?’ ‘It is saline.’ ‘Drink it from the bottom. How does it taste?’ ‘It is saline.’ ‘Throw the water away and then come to me.’ Śvetaketu did so. The father said to him:
‘That which is the subtlest of all is the Self of all this. It is the Truth. It is the Self. That thou art, O Śvetaketu .’ Śvetaketu then said, ‘Sir, please explain this to me again.’ ‘Yes, Somya, I will explain it again,’ replied his father.
O Somya, as when a person is brought blindfolded from the Gandhāra country and left in a deserted place, he turns sometimes to the east, sometimes to the north, sometimes to the south, and sometimes to the west, shouting: ‘I have been brought here blindfolded! I have been left here blindfolded!’—
—And as someone may remove that person’s blindfold and say, ‘ Gandhāra is this way; go this way,’ and the intelligent man goes from one village to another, asking his way and relying on the information people give, until he reaches Gandhāra; similarly, a person who gets a teacher attains knowledge. His delay is only as long as he is not free of his body. After that he becomes merged in the Self.
‘That which is the subtlest of all is the Self of all this. It is the Truth. It is the Self. That thou art, O Śvetaketu .’ Śvetaketu then said, ‘Sir, please explain this to me again.’ ‘Yes, Somya, I will explain it again,’ replied his father.
When a person is seriously ill, O Somya, his relatives sit around him and ask: ‘Do you recognize me? Do you recognize me?’ So long as his speech does not merge with his mind, his mind with his prāṇa , his prāṇa with the heat in his body, and the heat with the Supreme Self, he will be able to recognize them.
Then when his speech merges into his mind, his mind into prāṇa , his prāṇa into the heat in his body, and the heat into the Supreme Self, he no longer knows them.
‘That which is the subtlest of all is the Self of all this. It is the Truth. It is the Self. That thou art, O Śvetaketu .’ Śvetaketu then said, ‘Sir, please explain this to me again.’ ‘Yes, Somya, I will explain it again,’ replied his father.
O Somya, suppose a man is brought with his hands tied, and they say: ‘This man has stolen something. He has committed robbery. Heat up an axe for him.’ If he has committed the offence, then surely he will prove himself to be a liar. Being dishonest and trying to hide under the cover of falsehood, he will be burned when he grasps the hot axe, and then he will be killed.
But if he has not committed the offence, then surely he will prove himself to be truthful. Being honest, he will be protected by the cover of truth and will not be burned when he grasps the hot axe. He will then be set free.
‘That man, being honest, is not affected by the hot axe. That Self is the Self of all this. It is the Truth. It is the Self. That thou art, O Śvetaketu .’ Śvetaketu learnt this well from his father.
Nārada went for spiritual instruction to Sanatkumāra and said, ‘Sir, please teach me.’ Sanatkumāra said to him: ‘First tell me what you know already. I’ll teach you from that point.’ Nārada said—
Sir, I have read the Ṛg Veda , the Yajur Veda , the Sāma Veda , and the fourth—the Atharva Veda ; then the fifth—history and the Purāṇas ; also, grammar, funeral rites, mathematics, the science of omens, the science of underground resources, logic, moral science, astrology, Vedic knowledge , the science of the elements, archery, astronomy, the science relating to snakes, plus music, dance, and other fine arts. Sir, this is what I know.
‘True, I have learnt much, but I know only the word meaning. I do not know the Self. Sir, I have heard from great persons like you that only those who know the Self are able to overcome sorrow. I am suffering from sorrow. Please take me across the ocean of sorrow.’ Sanatkumāra then said to Nārada , ‘Everything you have learnt so far is just words’.
Name is the Ṛg Veda , the Yajur Veda , the Sāma Veda , and the fourth—the Atharva Veda ; then the fifth—history and the Purāṇas ; also, grammar, funeral rites, mathematics, the science of omens, the science of underground resources, logic, moral science, astrology, Vedic knowledge , the science of the elements, archery, astronomy, the science relating to snakes, plus music, dance, and other fine arts. These are only names. Worship name.
‘Anyone who worships name as Brahman can do what he pleases within the limits of the name.’ Nārada asked, ‘Sir, is there anything higher than name?’ ‘Of course there is something higher than name,’ replied Sanatkumāra . Nārada then said, ‘Sir, please explain that to me’.
Speech is certainly superior to name. Speech makes known the Ṛg Veda , the Yajur Veda , the Sāma Veda , and the fourth—the Atharva Veda ; then the fifth—history and the Purāṇas ; also, grammar, funeral rites, mathematics, the science of omens, the science of underground resources, logic, moral science, astrology, Vedic knowledge , the science of the elements, archery, astronomy, the science relating to snakes, plus music, dance, and other fine arts; also heaven and earth; air, space, water, and fire; the gods and human beings; cattle and birds; creepers and big trees; animals of prey as well as worms, fleas, and ants; merit and demerit; truth and untruth; good and evil; and the pleasant and the unpleasant. If speech did not exist there would be no awareness of merit and demerit, nor of truth and untruth, good and evil, the pleasant and the unpleasant. Speech alone makes it possible to understand all this. Worship speech.
‘Anyone who worships speech as Brahman can do what he pleases within the limits of speech.’ Nārada asked, ‘Sir, is there anything higher than speech?’ ‘Of course there is something higher than speech,’ replied Sanatkumāra . Nārada then said, ‘Sir, please explain that to me’.
The mind is superior to speech. Just as a person can hold in his fist two āmalaka fruits, or two kola fruits plums, or two akṣa fruits, so also the mind can hold within it both speech and name. If a person thinks, ‘I will read the mantras ,’ he reads them. If he thinks, ‘I will do this,’ he does it. If he decides, ‘I will have children and animals,’ he can try to have them. If he decides, ‘I will conquer this world and the next,’ he can try to do it. This is the characteristic of the mind. If it says it will do something, it can do it. The mind is the self. The mind is the world. The mind is Brahman . Worship the mind.
‘Anyone who worships the mind as Brahman can dp what he pleases within the limits of the mind.’ Nārada asked, ‘Sir, is there anything higher than the mind?’ ‘Of course there is something higher than the mind,’ replied Sanatkumāra . Nārada then said, ‘Sir, please explain that to me’.
The will is certainly superior to the mind. When a person wills, he starts thinking. Then he directs the organ of speech, and finally he makes the organ of speech utter the name. All the mantras merge in the names and all the actions merge in the mantras.
All these things mind, speech, name, etc. merge in saṅkalpa , arise from saṅkalpa, and are supported by saṅkalpa. That is the will decides the direction of everything you do. It is the soul of everything. Heaven and earth will, and so do air, space, water, and fire. That is, it is their will that determines their work. Through their will the rain wills, and through the will of the rain, food wills. The will of food is the will of life. The will of life is the will of the mantras , and the will of the mantras is the will of all activities. The will of the activities is the will of the worlds, and the will of the worlds determines the will of everything. Such is the will. Worship this will.
‘One who worships saṅkalpa as Brahman can attain any world he wills. He becomes true and attains the world of truth. He is firmly established and also attains a world which is firmly established. He is free from pain and attains also a world free from pain. One who worships saṅkalpa as Brahman can do what he pleases within the limits of saṅkalpa.’ Nārada asked, ‘Sir, is there anything higher than saṅkalpa?’ ‘Of course there is something higher than saṅkalpa,’ replied Sanatkumāra . Nārada then said, ‘Sir, please explain that to me’.
Intelligence is certainly superior to will-power. A person first comprehends, and then he wills. Next he thinks it over again and again, and then he directs the organ of speech. Finally he makes the organ of speech utter the name. All the mantras then merge in the names, and all the actions merge in the mantras.
All these will-power, mind, etc. merge in intelligence, are directed by intelligence, and are supported by intelligence. That is why, a person may be learned but if he is dull, people ignore him and say: ‘He does not exist, no matter how much he seems to know. If he were really learned, he would not be so foolish.’ On the other hand, if a person is not learned but he is intelligent, people will listen to him with respect. It is intelligence that governs all these. It is their soul and their support. Therefore, worship intelligence.
‘One who worships intelligence as Brahman attains worlds of intelligence i.e., things he regards as important. He becomes true and attains the world of truth. He is firmly established and also attains a world which is firmly established. He is free from pain and also attains a world free from pain. One who worships intelligence as Brahman can do what he pleases within the limits of intelligence.’ Nārada asked, ‘Sir, is there anything higher than intelligence?’ ‘Of course there is something higher than intelligence,’ replied Sanatkumāra . Nārada then said, ‘Sir, please explain that to me’.
Meditation is certainly superior to intelligence. The earth seems to be meditating. The space between the earth and heaven seems to be meditating. So also, heaven seems to be meditating. Water seems to be meditating. The mountains seem to be meditating. Gods and human beings also seem to be meditating.
‘One who worships meditation as Brahman can do what he pleases within the limits of meditation.’ Nārada asked, ‘Sir, is there anything higher than meditation?’ ‘Of course there is something higher than meditation,’ replied Sanatkumāra . Nārada then said, ‘Sir, please explain that to me’.
Vijñāna the practical application of knowledge is certainly superior to meditation. Through vijñāna one knows the Ṛg Veda , the Yajur Veda , the Sāma Veda , and the fourth—the Atharva Veda ; then the fifth—history and the Purāṇas ; also, grammar, funeral rites, mathematics, the science of omens, the science of underground resources, logic, moral science, astrology, Vedic knowledge , the science of the elements, archery, astronomy, the science relating to snakes, plus music, dance, and other fine arts; also heaven and earth; air, space, water, and fire; the gods and human beings; cattle and birds; creepers and big trees; animals of prey as well as worms, fleas, and ants; merit and demerit; truth and untruth; good and evil; the pleasant and the unpleasant; food and water; and this world and the other world. One knows all this through vijñāna. Worship vijñāna.
‘One who worships vijñāna as Brahman attains the vijñānamaya and jñānamaya worlds. One who worships vijñāna as Brahman can do what he pleases within the limits of vijñāna.’ Nārada asked, ‘Sir, is there anything higher than vijñāna?’ ‘Of course there is something higher than vijñāna,’ replied Sanatkumāra . Nārada then said, ‘Sir, please explain that to me’.
Strength is certainly superior to understanding. One strong person can make even a hundred people of understanding shake with fear. If a person is strong, he will be enthusiastic and up and about. He will then start serving his teacher, and while serving his teacher he will be close to him. While sitting close to the teacher, he Will watch him and listen to what he says. Then he will think it over and try to understand. He will then act on it, and finally he will grasp the inner meaning. Strength supports the earth. It also supports the interspace, heaven, the mountains, gods and human beings, cattle, birds, creepers, and trees. It supports animals of prey as well as worms, fleas, and ants. It supports the whole world. Worship strength.
‘One who worships strength as Brahman can do what he pleases within the limits of strength.’ Nārada asked, ‘Sir, is there anything higher than strength?’ ‘Of course there is something higher than strength,’.
Food is certainly superior to strength. This is why if a person fasts for ten days and nights, he may survive but he will not be able to see, hear, think, understand, work, or fully grasp the meaning of what he is taught. But if he eats food, he can then see, hear, think, understand, work, and fully grasp the meaning of the teachings. Therefore worship food.
‘One who worships food as Brahman attains worlds full of food and drink. One who worships food as Brahman can do what he pleases within the limits of food.’ Nārada asked, ‘Sir, is there anything higher than food?’ ‘Of course there is something higher than food,’ replied Sanatkumāra . Nārada then said, ‘Sir, please explain that to me’.
Water is certainly superior to food. That is why if there is no rain, people worry and think, ‘There will not be enough food.’ But if there is a good rainfall, they are happy, thinking, ‘There will be plenty of food.’ All these are water in different forms: the earth, the interspace, heaven, the mountains, gods and human beings, cattle and birds, creepers and trees, animals of prey, worms, insects, and ants. All these are water in different forms. Therefore worship water.
‘One who worships water as Brahman gets all he desires and is happy. One who worships water as Brahman can do what he pleases within the limits of water.’ Nārada asked, ‘Sir, is there anything higher than water?’ ‘Of course there is something higher than water,’ replied Sanatkumāra . Nārada then said, ‘Sir, please explain that to me’.
Fire or, heat is certainly better than water. That fire, taking air as its support, heats the sky. Then people say: ‘It is very hot. The body is burning. It will rain soon.’ Fire first produces these signs, and then creates the rain. This is why there is lightning going straight up or going sideways in a zigzag manner, and along with it thunder. This is why people say: ‘There is lightning and thunder. It will rain soon’.
‘One who worships fire as Brahman becomes bright himself, and he attains worlds that are bright, shining, and without a hint of darkness. One who worships fire as Brahman can do what he pleases within the range of fire.’ Nārada asked, ‘Sir, is there anything higher than tejas ?’ ‘Of course there is something higher than tejas,’ replied Sanatkumāra . Nārada then said, ‘Sir, please explain that to me’.
Ākāśa space is certainly superior to fire. The sun and the moon are both within ākāśa, and so are lightning, the stars, and fire. Through ākāśa one person is able to speak to another. Through ākāśa one is able to hear. And through ākāśa one is able to hear what others are saying. In ākāśa one enjoys, and in ākāśa one suffers. A person is born in ākāśa, and plants and trees grow pointing to ākāśa. Worship ākāśa.
‘One who worships ākāśa space as Brahman attains worlds that are spacious, shining, free from all drawbacks, and extensive. One who worships ākāśa as Brahman can do what he pleases within the range of ākāśa.’ Nārada asked, ‘Sir, is there anything higher than ākāśa?’ ‘Of course there is something higher than ākāśa,’ replied Sanatkumāra . Nārada then said, ‘Sir, please explain that to me’.
Memory is certainly superior to ākāśa space. This is why, if many people get together but their memory fails, then they cannot hear or think or know anything. But if they remember, they can then hear, think, and know. Through memory one knows one’s children and animals. Therefore, worship memory.
‘One who worships memory as Brahman has free movement as far as memory goes.’ Nārada asked, ‘Sir, is there anything higher than memory?’ ‘Of course there is something higher than memory,’ replied Sanatkumāra . Nārada then said, ‘Sir, please explain that to me’.
Hope is certainly better than memory. Hope inspires a person’s memory, and one uses one’s memory to learn the mantras and perform rituals. One then wishes for children and animals, and one also wishes to attain this world and the next. Therefore, worship hope.
‘One who worships hope as Brahman has all his desires fulfilled. He gets whatever he wants without fail. One who worships hope as Brahman has free movement as far as hope goes.’ Nārada asked, ‘Sir, is there anything higher than hope?’ ‘Of course there is something higher than hope,’ replied Sanatkumāra . Nārada then said, ‘Sir, please explain that to me’.
Prāṇa the vital force is certainly superior to hope. Just as spokes on a wheel are attached to the hub, similarly everything rests on prāṇa. Prāṇa works through its own power i.e., prāṇa is the means as well as the end. Prāṇa gives prāṇa to prāṇa, and prāṇa directs prāṇa to prāṇa. Prāṇa is the father, prāṇa is the mother, prāṇa is the brother, prāṇa is the sister, prāṇa is the teacher, and prāṇa is the brāhmin.
If a person speaks rudely to his father, mother, brother, sister, teacher, or to a brāhmin, people say to him: ‘Shame on you! You have murdered your father. You have murdered your mother. You have murdered your brother. You have murdered your sister. You have murdered your teacher. You have murdered a brāhmin’.
But when they have died, if a person piles their bodies on a funeral pyre and bums them, piercing them with a spear so that the body burns more quickly, no one will say to him, ‘You have killed your father,’ or ‘You have killed your mother,’ or ‘You have killed your brother,’ or ‘You have killed your sister,’ or ‘You have killed your teacher,’ or ‘You have killed a brāhmin’.
It is prāṇa that is all this. He who sees thus, thinks thus, and knows thus becomes a superior speaker. If anyone says to him, ‘You are a superior speaker,’ he may say, ‘Yes, I am a superior speaker.’ He need not deny it.
‘But a person must first know the Truth. Then he is truly an ativādī.’ Nārada said, ‘Sir, I want to be an ativādī by knowing the Truth.’ Sanatkumāra replied, ‘But one must earnestly desire to know the Truth.’ ‘Sir, I earnestly desire to know the Truth,’ Nārada said.
Sanatkumāra said: ‘When a person knows for certain, then he can truly speak of the Truth. But without knowing well, he cannot speak of the Truth. One who knows for certain speaks of Truth. But one must seek knowledge in depth.’ Nārada said, ‘Sir, I seek knowledge in depth’.
Sanatkumāra said: ‘When a person learns to think well, then he can know deeply. Without thinking well, one cannot know deeply. One knows for certain when one thinks deeply. But one must want to know how to think well.’ Nārada replied, ‘Sir, I want to know how to think well’.
Sanatkumāra said: ‘When a person has respect for what he hears, then he gives due thought to it. Without this respect he attaches ho importance to what he hears. One thinks deeply over something that one respects. But one must try to attain this respect.’ Nārada replied, ‘Sir, I want to have this respect’.
Sanatkumāra : ‘When a person is steady and devoted to his teacher, then he has respect. Without being steady, one cannot have respect. One has steadiness when one has genuine respect and devotion. But one must seek this steadiness with great earnestness.’ Nārada replied, ‘I seek this steadiness’.
Sanatkumāra said: ‘When a person keeps doing his duty, he becomes steady. If one does not do one’s duty, one cannot have steadiness. One attains steadiness by doing one’s duty. But one should try to know what duty means.’ Nārada replied, ‘Sir, I want to know about duty’.
Sanatkumāra said: ‘A person works when he gets happiness. He does not care to work if he does not get happiness. By getting happiness one does one’s duty. But one must try to understand the true nature of this happiness.’ Nārada replied, ‘Sir, I want to know well the true nature of happiness’.
Sanatkumāra said: ‘That which is infinite is the source of happiness. There is no happiness in the finite. Happiness is only in the infinite. But one must try to understand what the infinite is.’ Nārada replied, ‘Sir, I want to clearly understand the infinite’.
Sanatkumāra said: ‘Bhūmā the infinite is that in which one sees nothing else, hears nothing else, and knows i.e., finds nothing else. But alpa the finite is that in which one sees something else, hears something else, and knows something else. That which is infinite is immortal, and that which is finite is mortal.’ Nārada asked, ‘Sir, what does bhūmā rest on?’ Sanatkumāra replied, ‘It rests on its own power—or not even on that power i.e., it depends on nothing else’.
In this world it is said that cattle, horses, elephants, gold, servants, wives, farmlands, and houses are a person’s glory. I do not mean this type of glory, for these things are not independent of each other. This is what I am talking about—
That bhūmā is below; it is above; it is behind; it is in front; it is to the right; it is to the left. All this is bhūmā. Now, as regards one’s own identity: I am below; I am above; I am behind; I am in front; I am to the right; I am to the left. I am all this.
Next is the instruction on the Self: The Self is below; the Self is above; the Self is behind; the Self is in front; the Self is to the right; the Self is to the left. The Self is all this. He who sees in this way, thinks in this way, and knows in this way, has love for the Self, sports with the Self, enjoys the company of the Self, and has joy in the Self, he is supreme and can go about as he likes in all the worlds. But those who think otherwise are under the control of others. They cannot remain in the worlds they live in, nor can they move about in the worlds as they like i.e., they are under many limitations.
For a person like this who sees in this way, thinks in this way, and has this knowledge, everything comes from the Self: Life, hope, memory, space, fire, water, birth and death, food, strength, knowledge in depth, meditation, the heart, resolution, the mind, speech, name, mantras , and all work—all this comes from the Self.
Here is a verse on the subject: ‘He who has realized the Self does not see death. For him there is no disease or sorrow. Such a seer sees everything as it is and also attains everything in whatever way he wants.’ He is one i.e., before creation; but after creation, he is in three forms, five forms, seven forms, and nine forms. Then again, he is in eleven, a hundred and ten, and even a thousand and twenty forms. If one eats pure food, one’s mind becomes pure. If the mind is pure, one’s memory becomes strong and steady. If the memory is good, one becomes free from all bondages. The revered Sanatkumāra freed Nārada from all his shortcomings and led him beyond darkness i.e., ignorance. The wise say that Sanatkumāra is a man of perfect knowledge.
Om. This body is the city of Brahman . Within it is an abode in the shape of a lotus i.e., the heart, and within that there is a small space. One must search within this space and earnestly desire to know what is there.
If the disciples ask, ‘This body is the city of Brahman ; within it is an abode in the shape of a lotus i.e., the heart, and within that there is a small space; what is it that one must search for within this space, and what should one earnestly desire to know?’—the teacher should reply:
The teacher replies: ‘The space in the heart is as big as the space outside. Heaven and earth are both within it, so also fire and air, the sun and the moon, lightning and the stars. Everything exists within that space in the embodied self—whatever it has or does not have’.
If the disciples ask the teacher, ‘If in this body brahmapura are all this, all things, and all desires, is there anything left behind when the body gets old or perishes?’—
—in reply the teacher will say: ‘The body may decay due to old age, but the space within i.e., brahmapura never decays. Nor does it perish with the death of the body. This is the real abode of Brahman . All our desires are concentrated in it. It is the Self—free from all sins as well as from old age, death, bereavement, hunger, and thirst. It is the cause of love of Truth and the cause of dedication to Truth. If a person strictly follows whatever the ruler of the country commands, he may then get as a reward some land, or even an estate’.
Everything perishes, whether it is something you have acquired through hard work in this world or it is a place in the other world which you have acquired through meritorious deeds. Those who leave this world without knowing the Self and the Truths which they should know are not free, no matter where they go. But those who leave this world after knowing the Self and the Truths which they should know are free, no matter where they are.
If that person wishes to be in the company of his forefathers, they appear before him as he wishes. Joining his forefathers in that world, he becomes great.
Then if he wishes to be in the company of mothers, they appear before him as he wishes. Joining the mothers in that world, he becomes great.
Then if he wishes to be in the company of brothers, they appear before him as he wishes. Joining the brothers in that world, he becomes great.
Then if he wishes to be in the company of sisters, they appear before him as he wishes. Joining the sisters in that world, he becomes great.
Then if he wishes to be in the company of friends, they appear before him as he wishes. Joining friends in that world, he becomes great.
Then if he wishes for a world of fragrant flower garlands, they appear before him as he wishes. By having fragrant flower garlands in that world, he becomes great.
Then if he wishes for a world of food and drink, they appear before him as he wishes. By having food and drink in that world, he becomes great.
Then if he wishes for a world of music, that world appears to him as he wishes. By enjoying music in that world, he becomes great.
Then if he wishes for the company of women, they appear before him as he wishes. Being with women in that world, he becomes great.
Whatever province he wishes for, whatever good thing he wishes to have, it appears before him just as he wishes. By acquiring it, he becomes great.
But all these true desires are under a false cover. Though they rest on the Self, they are all false. This is why if a relative dies, one does not see him again in this world.
Further, those of his relatives who are still alive and those who are dead, and also those things a person cannot get even if he wishes for them—all these he gets by going within his heart. All true desires of a person are in his heart, though they are hidden. It is like when there is gold hidden someplace underground and people who are ignorant of it walk over that spot again and again, knowing nothing about it. Similarly, all these beings go to Brahmaloka every day, and yet they know nothing about it because they are covered by ignorance.
The Self resides in the heart. The word hṛdayam is derived thus: hṛdi + ayam —‘it is in the heart.’ Therefore the heart is called hṛdayam . One who knows thus goes daily to the heavenly world i.e., in his dreamless sleep he is one with Brahman .
The teacher said: ‘Then, this person, who is the embodiment of happiness, emerging from the body and attaining the highest light, assumes his real nature. This is the Self. It is immortal and also fearless. It is Brahman . Another name for Brahman is satya , Truth.’
Sa, tī , and yam —these are the three syllables which represent Brahman . Sa stands for that which is immortal. Ti stands for that which is mortal. And yam stands for that which controls both the mortal and the immortal. As both the mortal and the immortal are controlled by it, it is called yam . The person who knows the significance of these three syllables enjoys divine bliss every day in dreamless sleep.
Next, this Self is like a dam. It supports the worlds and protects them from getting mixed up. Day and night cannot cross over this dam, nor can old age, death, bereavement, good actions, and bad actions. All sins turn away from it, for this Brahmaloka is free from evil.
Therefore, by crossing this dam, if you are blind you do not feel you are blind. Similarly, if you are hurt, you do not feel you are hurt, and if you are mentally upset, you no longer feel the sorrow. This is why if you cross this dam, even night will be like day, for this world of Brahman is always full of light.
Those who attain this Brahmaloka through brahmacarya become the masters of Brahmaloka. They can visit all worlds as they like.
Then that which is known as yajña sacrifice is brahmacarya . This is because one who knows the Self attains Brahmaloka through brahmacarya. Again, that which is known as iṣṭa worship is brahmacarya, for the desired Self is attained through brahmacarya.
Then, that which is known as ‘Sattrāyaṇa’ a sacrifice lasting a long time is brahmacarya , for it is through brahmacarya that the individual self gets liberated attains union with the Cosmic Self. Then, that which is called ‘ mauna ’ silence is brahmacarya, for through brahmacarya one realizes the Self, and having realized the Self one remains absorbed in the thought of it.
Then, that which is known as ‘anāśakāyana’ the path of fasting is brahmacarya , for through brahmacarya one attains the Self which is immortal. Then, that which is called ‘araṇyāyana’ life in the forest is brahmacarya. This is because in Brahmaloka , which is the third world from the earth, there are two oceans called Ara and Ṇya. There also one finds a lake called Airammadīya so-called because its waters are intoxicating, a peepal tree always exuding soma juice, a city called Aparājitā the Invincible belonging to Brahmā , and a canopy of gold specially made by the Lord.
When they attain through brahmacarya the two oceans, Ara and Ṇya, in Brahmaloka , that Brahmaloka is theirs, and they can then move freely in all the worlds.
Then these veins connected with the heart are each filled with a thin liquid, coloured reddish-yellow, white, blue, yellow, and red. The sun there also has these colours—reddish-yellow, white, blue, yellow, and red.
Just as a big, broad road connects one village with another one which is far-off, in the same way, the rays emerge from the sun and reach out to a person, connecting one with the other. After entering the veins of that person, they emerge from them and then go back into the sun.
When a person is sound asleep, all his organs are inactive and quiet. He is free from all worries, and he does not have any dreams. The organs then disappear into the veins. No sin can affect him then, for the rays of the sun have surrounded him.
Then when a person becomes weak, his relations sit around him and keep asking: ‘Do you know me? Do you know me?’ As long as he has not left the body, he is able to recognize them.
Then when a person leaves the body, he goes upward with the help of these rays. If he dies while meditating on Om, his going up is assured; otherwise not. In the amount of time it takes his mind to move from one thought to another he can reach the realm of the sun. The sun is the gateway to Brahmaloka . Those who known the meaning of Om and think of it at the time of death enter Brahmaloka, but those who are ignorant of it have no chance of entering.
There is a verse about this: There are a hundred and one arteries connected with the heart. One of them goes up to the top of the head. A person who goes up following this artery attains immortality. The other arteries go in different directions and cause one to depart from the body in other ways.
Prajāpati once said: ‘The Self is free from sin, free from old age, free from death, free from sorrow, and free from hunger and thirst. It is the cause of desire for Truth and for commitment to Truth. This Self has to be sought for and thoroughly known. The person who has sought for and known the Self attains all worlds and all desires’.
Both the gods and the demons came to know from people what Prajāpati had said. They said, ‘We shall search for that Self, by knowing which we can attain all the worlds and whatever things we desire.’ With this object in view, Indra among the gods and Virocana among the demons went to Prajāpati, carrying fuel in their hands. But they did not let each other know their plans.
Both of them spent thirty-two years there living as brahmacarins . One day Prajāpati said to them: ‘For what purpose are you staying here?’ They replied: ‘“The Self is free from sin, free from old age, free from death, free from sorrow, and free from hunger and thirst. It is the cause of desire for Truth and for commitment to Truth. This Self has to be sought for and thoroughly known. The person who has learned about the Self and known it attains all worlds and all desires.”—Sir, this is your message. We wish to know that Self, and this is why we are here’.
Prajāpati said to those two, ‘That which is seen in the eyes is the Self.’ He also said: ‘This Self is immortal and fearless. It is Brahman .’ Then they asked: ‘Lord, we see something when we look in water and again when we look in a mirror. Which is it?’ Prajāpati replied, ‘The Self is seen in all these’.
Prajāpati said: ‘Look at yourselves in a vessel full of water. If you have any doubts about the Self then let me know.’ They then looked at themselves in the water, and Prajāpati asked, ‘What do you see?’ They replied, ‘We see the reflection of our whole self, including even our hair and nails’.
Prajāpati said to them, ‘After getting well-dressed and putting on fine clothes and making yourselves neat and clean, then look into the pan of water.’ So the two of them got well-dressed in fine clothes, and made themselves neat and clean. Then they looked into the water. Prajāpati asked, ‘What do you see?’.
The two of them said, ‘Revered sir, just as we are well-dressed in fine clothes, and neat and clean, in the same way, these two reflections are well-dressed in fine clothes, and neat and clean.’ Prajāpati said: ‘That is the Self. It is immortal and fearless. It is Brahman .’ The two of them left then, happy in mind.
Seeing them leave, Prajāpati said to himself: ‘They are going without realizing or knowing anything about the Self. Anyone among them, whether a god or a demon, who will understand the teaching this way thinking the body to be the Self will be lost.’ Virocana , the king of the demons, went back to the demons happy in mind and explained to them the upaniṣad :
This is why in this world even today people say, ‘Oh, he is a demon,’ if that person is devoid of the feeling of charity, has no respect for others, and never cares to perform a sacrifice, because the demons have the idea that the body is the Self. When a person dies they decorate the body with all kinds of offerings, new clothes, and jewellery, for they think that by this, the person will conquer the other world.
But even before Indra returned to the gods, a doubt arose in his mind: ‘When the body is well decorated, the reflection is also well decorated. When the body is in fine clothes, the reflection is also in fine clothes. When the body is neat and clean, the reflection is also neat and clean. Again, suppose a person is blind. Then the reflection will show a blind body. Or if the body is lame, the reflection will show a lame body. Or if the body is hurt in some way, the reflection will show the same. Then again, if the body is destroyed, the reflection is gone. I don’t see that anything good will come from this’.
Indra returned with fuel in hand. Prajāpati asked: ‘Indra, you left with Virocana happy in mind. What has made you come back?’ Indra replied: ‘Lord, when the body is well decorated, the reflection is also well decorated. When the body is in fine clothes, the reflection is also in fine clothes. When the body is neat and clean, the reflection is also neat and clean. Again, suppose a person is blind. Then the reflection will show a blind body. Or if the body is lame, the reflection will show a lame body. Or if the body is hurt in some way, the reflection will show the same. Then again, if the body is destroyed, the reflection is gone. I don’t see anything good in this’.
Prajāpati said: ‘ Indra , it is so. I will explain the matter to you again. Stay here another thirty-two years.’ Indra lived another thirty-two years there. Then Prajāpati said to him—
‘That person who goes about being worshipped in dreams is the Self. It is immortal and fearless. It is Brahman .’ Indra then left happy in mind. But even before he returned to the gods, a doubt arose in his mind: ‘A person may be blind, but when he is dreaming he is not blind. He may be lame, but when he is dreaming he is not lame. There may be some defects in his body, but his dream body is not affected by them’.
‘The body may be killed but the other is not killed. Nor is the dream body lame if the body is lame. Nevertheless, in dreams it may seem as if people are killing him; it may seem as if people are chasing him; it may seem as if there is something unpleasant. He may even seem to be weeping. I see nothing good in this’.
Indra returned with fuel in hand. Prajāpati asked: ‘Indra, you left happy in mind. What has made you come back?’ Indra replied: ‘Lord, a person may be blind, but when he is dreaming he is not blind. He may be lame, but when he is dreaming he is not lame. There may be some defects in his body, but his dream body is not affected by them’.
‘The body may be killed but the other is not killed. Nor is the dream body lame if the body is lame. Nevertheless, in dreams it may seem as if people are killing him; it may seem as if people are chasing him; it may seem as if there is something unpleasant. He may even seem to be weeping. I see nothing good in this.’ Prajāpati said: ‘ Indra , it is so. I will explain the matter to you again. Stay here another thirty-two years.’ Indra lived another thirty-two years there. Then Prajāpati said to him—
Prajāpati said: ‘When the self is sleeping, with all its organs inactive, it is free from worry and has no dreams. This is what the Self is like i.e., it is spotless. It is immortal and fearless. It is Brahman .’ Indra left happy in mind. But even before he got back to the gods, he was troubled by a doubt: ‘When the self is in deep sleep, it is not able to recognize itself as “I am so-and-so,” as it does when it is awake. Not only that, it does not even recognize beings around it. It is as if the self has been obliterated. I don’t see that anything good will come from this’.
Indra returned with fuel in hand. Prajāpati asked: ‘Indra, you left happy in mind. What has made you come back?’ Indra replied: ‘Lord, when the self is in deep sleep, it is not able to recognize itself as “I am so-and-so,” as it does when it is awake. Not only that, it does not even recognize beings around it. It is as if the self has been obliterated. I don’t see anything good coming from this’.
Prajāpati said: ‘ Indra , it is so. I will explain the matter to you again. Stay here another five years.’ Indra lived there another five years. The total time Indra spent thus was one hundred and one years. This is what sages refer to when they say, ‘Indra lived with Prajāpati for one hundred and one years practising brahmacarya .’ Then Prajāpati said to him—
Indra , this body is mortal. It has been captured by death. Yet it is the base of the Self, which is immortal and formless. One who has a body is subject to both happiness and unhappiness. In fact, there is no end to happiness and unhappiness so long as one has a body. But when a person is free from the body, nothing good or bad can touch him.
The air is formless. So also are clouds, lightning, and thunder. All these arise from the sky and assume their respective forms due to the heat of the sun.
In the same way, the joyful self arises from the body and, attaining the light of the Cosmic Self, appears in his own form. This is the Paramātman , the Cosmic Self. He then freely moves about eating, playing, or enjoying himself with women, carriages, or relatives, not remembering at all the body in which he was born. Just as horses or bullocks are harnessed to carriages, similarly prāṇa life remains harnessed to the body due to karma .
Next, this organ of vision lies inside the space in the eyes. That is where the deity presiding over the eyes i.e., the Self is. The eye is the instrument through which the Self sees. Next, the one who knows ‘I am smelling this’ is the Self. The organ of smell is the instrument through which the Self smells. Next, the one who knows ‘I am speaking this’ is the Self. The organ of speech is the instrument through which the Self speaks. Next, the one who knows ‘I hear this’ is the Self. The organ of hearing is the instrument through which the Self hears.
Then, it is the Self which knows ‘I am thinking this.’ The mind is its divine eye. The Self, now free, enjoys seeing everything it wants to see in Brahmaloka through its divine mental eye.
This Self is worshipped by the gods. This is why all worlds and all desirable things are within their grasp. One who fully understands and realizes this Self with the help of teachers and the scriptures is able to attain whatever worlds and whatever desirable things he wants. This is what Prajāpati taught Indra .
From the dark may I attain the diverse. From the diverse may I attain the dark. Like a horse shaking its fur to remove the dirt, I will shake off whatever spot I may have on my character. Like the moon freeing itself from the mouth of Rāhu and regaining its brightness, I will, having accomplished everything, lay down this body and attain that eternal Brahmaloka .
That which is described as space manifests names and forms. These names and forms are within Brahman . Brahman is immortal; it is the Self. May I attend the court of Prajāpati . May I attain the fame of a brāhmin, and also of a prince and a merchant. I wish to have real fame. I want to be famous among all famous people. May I not have to be born again and have a body covered with blood and dirt, which is toothless and at the same time always wanting to eat.
Brahmā taught this knowledge of the Self to Prajāpati , and Prajāpati taught it to Manu . Manu, in his turn, taught it to all human beings. A young man goes to live at his teacher’s house and serves him, and when he is free he studies the Vedas in the prescribed manner. After finishing all his studies, he goes back home and marries. But he continues to study the scriptures in a sacred place. He also teaches his children and disciples in such a way that they will be religious. He keeps all his senses under control and avoids violence unless he is at a holy place. This is how he lives his whole life. Then after death he goes to Brahmaloka , and he is not born again, he is not born again.
